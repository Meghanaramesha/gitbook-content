## What are YouTube Shorts?

YouTube Shorts is a short-form video-sharing platform offered by YouTube. The platform hosts user content much like YouTube’s primary service, but limits pieces to 60 seconds in length. **Since its launch, YouTube Shorts has accumulated over 5 trillion views.**

What are Youtube Shorts for?  YouTube Shorts is **a way for anyone to connect with a new audience using just a smartphone and the Shorts camera in the YouTube app**. YouTube’s Shorts creation tools makes it easy to create short-form videos that are up to 60 seconds long with our multi-segment camera.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J38Yq85ZoyY

## What is the Advantage of Youtube Shorts?

An advantage of YouTube Shorts is that it makes video content highly accessible, whether for the creator or consumer. This accessibility is achieved through a focus on content created and viewed through mobile devices

## **How to Overcome Challenges When Adding YouTube Shorts to Google UAC Campaigns?**

To overcome challenges when adding youtube shorts to google UAC you need to do following things:

Since you are an [User Acquisition manager](http://lancaric.me), you are [refreshing the creatives frequently](https://lancaric.me/creative-framework-in-the-post-idfa-world/) on Google UAC. You need to add those creatives on Youtube first and then add them to campaigns. Lets look at how it is done:

## What are the Tips to Use Youtube Shorts for User Acquisition?

Here are some effective tips for using YouTube Shorts for User Acquisition:

**Leverage Engaging Hooks:**

Start your Shorts with a powerful hook in the first 3 seconds to grab viewers’ attention. An engaging opening can significantly boost your watch time and conversion rates.

**Optimize for Mobile Users:**

Since Shorts are primarily consumed on mobile, ensure your content is visually appealing, easy to follow, and quick to convey value. Use large, bold text overlays and vibrant visuals to keep viewers engaged.

**Use Trends and Challenges:**

Tap into trending content and popular challenges that resonate with your audience. By aligning your content with current trends, you increase discoverability and appeal to a broader audience.

**Include Clear CTAs (Calls to Action)**

Every YouTube Short should have a clear call to action, whether it’s asking users to visit your website, download your app, or watch another video. Make sure your CTAs are compelling and easy to follow.

**Create Multi-part Content:**

Use series or multi-part content to keep viewers coming back for more. This encourages users to follow your channel and engage with more of your content, improving retention.

**Utilize YouTube Shorts in Your Campaigns:**

Upload your Shorts to Google Universal App Campaigns (UAC) to increase visibility. Use video hashes in Google UAC to make your Shorts work seamlessly for creative testing and refreshes.

**A/B Test Creatives:**

Test different versions of Shorts to determine which format, messaging, and creative style attract more users. You can analyze key metrics to identify the best-performing creative.

**Utilize Short Hashtags:**

Include relevant hashtags to improve discoverability. YouTube’s algorithm uses hashtags to categorize content, so leverage popular and relevant tags to reach more users.

**Collaborate with Influencers:**

Partner with influencers who resonate with your target audience to create Shorts that feature your app or game. Influencer collaborations help build trust and drive more user acquisitions.

**Refresh Creatives Regularly:**

Update your Shorts frequently to keep the content fresh. Use the video hash trick to add updated content to your campaigns without downtime, which helps prevent creative fatigue.

**Link to Longer Content:**

Use YouTube Shorts to provide a teaser for longer content on your channel or related content about your game or app, driving further engagement and interaction.
