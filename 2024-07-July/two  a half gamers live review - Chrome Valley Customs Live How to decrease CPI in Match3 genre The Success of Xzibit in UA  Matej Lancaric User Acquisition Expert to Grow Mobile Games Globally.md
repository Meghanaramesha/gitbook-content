##### **Summary**

In this episode, Matej and Jakub are joined by Dmitry from Space Ape to discuss the game Chrome Valley Customs and its unique marketing approach. They explore the game’s mechanics, target audience, and the success of using Xzibit from the TV show Pimp My Ride in their creatives. Dmitry shares insights into the marketability tests they conducted and the decision to focus on car restoration as a fantasy to engage players. They also discuss the competition in the male-oriented match-three genre and the challenges of running UA campaigns for this audience. The conversation with Dmitry Gubanenkov focused on the marketing strategies and creative approaches used by Boombit Games for their game Chrome Valley Customs. They discussed the success of partnering with a popular TV personality, the effectiveness of different creative formats, the importance of testing and iterating on creatives, and the selection of UA channels. Dmitry also mentioned the value of competitive research and the role of the creative team in producing high-performing ads.

##### **Takeaways**

Chrome Valley Customs is a match-three game that targets a male audience, which is unique in the genre dominated by female players.  
The game’s success can be attributed to its engaging car restoration theme and the use of Xzibit from Pimp My Ride in their creatives.  
Marketability tests and surveys helped shape the game’s concept and appeal to the target audience.  
Running UA campaigns for a male audience in the match-three genre can be challenging due to high CPIs and the need for scalable creatives.  
Competition in the male-oriented match-three genre is increasing, with other developers releasing similar games. Partnering with a popular TV personality can help reach a core audience and create a strong connection with players.  
Using a variety of creative formats, such as static, playable videos, and long-form videos, can be effective in different channels and for different audiences.  
Testing and iterating on creatives is crucial for finding the most successful ad concepts and improving performance metrics.  
Competitive research is important for staying informed about industry trends and finding inspiration for new creatives.  
Having an in-house creative team can lead to better-performing ads, as they have a deeper understanding of the game and can capture its unique appeal.  
Selecting UA channels should be based on a combination of experience, internal discussions, and industry insights, considering factors like scale, spend, and profitability.
