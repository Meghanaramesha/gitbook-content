This is what you get in this AI UGC video guide:
------------------------------------------------

* A practical guide to creating AI-powered UGC videos for mobile game marketing, completed in under 1 hour
* Leveraged stock footage, Canva, and AI UGC tools like [poolday.ai](http://poolday.ai/) to create 15 videos (including 9 AI UGC)
* Combined trending “wall of text” style with spooky-themed content for a Pocket Necromancer and found 3+ winners
* **The total production cost is approximately $7 per AI UGC video**
* Multiple video variations were tested in Facebook UA campaigns, with V1 and V5 showing immediate budget spend **(40% CPI decrease with triple ROAS)**
* AI UGC videos demonstrated better conversion rates than traditional UGC content

Frustrated by rising CPIs, I decided to take action. While I have 10 talented motion designers on my creative team, I wanted to experiment in this AI era. I love trying new things and still enjoy [getting my hands dirty on the UA side](http://lancaric.me/), so why not dive into the creative side, too?

On [two & a half gamers](https://youtu.be/G83ZsDABGUE), we launched a segment about creative trends a few months ago, giving me insight into what works across different games, genres, and apps. I’ve created 15 different videos with UGC variations, which significantly improved performance.

**Let’s dive in:**

**Research**
------------

It’s the weekend, and I don’t want to bother my motion designers. I start quick research on Adobe Stock, Envato, and other stock banks. I’m looking for “Halloween spooky footage” since I’m running a game called Pocket Necromancer.

Here are some initial picks:

1. [first video](https://elements.envato.com/looped-halloween-background-of-foggy-cemetery-and--3T644BU)
2. [second video](https://elements.envato.com/a-scary-night-on-the-graveyard-the-skeletons-are-w-EBZNPD8)
3. [third video](https://elements.envato.com/the-grim-reaper-and-fearful-death-executioner-T5BEZRY)

Research continues [here](https://stock.adobe.com/search/video?filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aphoto%5D=0&filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aillustration%5D=0&filters%5Bcontent_type%3Azip_vector%5D=0&filters%5Bcontent_type%3Avideo%5D=1&filters%5Bcontent_type%3Atemplate%5D=0&filters%5Bcontent_type%3A3d%5D=0&filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aaudio%5D=0&filters%5Binclude_stock_enterprise%5D=0&filters%5Bis_editorial%5D=0&filters%5Bfree_collection%5D=0&filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aimage%5D=0&k=grim+reaper&order=relevance&search_page=1&search_type=usertyped&acp=&aco=grim+reaper&get_facets=0&asset_id=927254650).

This caught my attention the most.

Creatives should be attention-grabbing. **Check!**

Creatives are about emotions. **Check!**

Creatives should be trendy. **Not Check!**

Recent Trends
-------------

But there was a different trend I had in mind that I have been seeing for some time.

This was exactly it! This “wall of text” trend is all over the app business.

Let’s fire up [canva.com](http://canva.com/) and start working on the real video *(it’s still Saturday, and I don’t want to bother anyone else; I am around **15 minutes** into this creative production!).*

My daughter takes a short lunch nap, so I have about 45 more minutes until she wakes up.

I have a few static images that performed well on Facebook; I have this grim reaper video from Adobe Stock. I will need a Halloween spooky sound, but that’s easy peasy with Envato.

**Here we go:**

[1-55\_01.mp3](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/54a2e007-bed9-457a-9658-e9a20ad1ccd9/b1b03cf1-35ac-467e-8295-44ba231e1fe9/1-55_01.mp3)

Perfect! Adding a nice vibe.

Final video
-----------

As I said, I played around with some static images and videos. Created 5 different variations and added all of them in the [User Acquisition](http://lancaric.me/) campaign mix on Facebook.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa81f6df-2ce3-4f46-be6d-feead3cbce1c_2048x951.png)

The V1 and V5 immediately started spending the budget.

I didn’t really end here and added one small twist that I felt will give the concept a whole new level of emotions:

Agree? 😊

AI UGC
------

I have been playing around with AI UGC videos for 2 years before it was cool! These creatives are converting better than real UGC right now…

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b3ad3e-2a8c-4365-be2d-6f1c3790397d_2048x1007.png)

Just made 9 UGC ads in less than 5 minutes with [poolday.ai](http://poolday.ai/)

I uploaded the main video, selected different AI actors, and pushed the button to generate videos. There are different hooks and formats available, but in this case, I only used the 9:16 format and no hook. I will use hooks in the next iteration. Let me know if you are interested in learning more about that too!

**↳ It costs me not more than $7 a video.**

AI is changing the game for games, apps, consultants like me, and agencies, too!

You can join the waitlist on [poolday.ai](http://poolday.ai/) to get the most out of your AI UGC game.

*Oh, btw, this is the best performer now!*

Started testing a new batch of UGC videos right away.

### Takeaways & numbers

Used these tools:

* Midjourney (free version), [Envato](https://elements.envato.com/) ($16,50 per month), [Canva](http://canva.com/) with animate image plugin ($13,90 per month)
* [Adobe stock videos](https://stock.adobe.com/) (Free trial → 3 videos for free, $69 per month after)
* [Poolday.ai](http://poolday.ai/) (Free trial)

Made 15 videos in total (9 AI UGC), finished before my daughter woke up.

**TOTAL TIME: 54 minutes**

Anything that I missed?
