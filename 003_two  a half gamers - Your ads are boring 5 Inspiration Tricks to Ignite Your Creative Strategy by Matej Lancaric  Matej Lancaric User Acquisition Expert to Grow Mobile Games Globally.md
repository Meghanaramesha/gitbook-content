Use the FB Ads library, TikTok Ad library, and Google Ads transparency center; on top of that, use Adscan.ai to spy on your competitors and see which creative is spending the most in Europe (the most-spending creative is most likely their best-performing creative at that moment). I usually use a combination of the above-mentioned free tools and Sensor Tower—a quite good combo! Go and see the top creatives in the last 30 days; they give you super interesting insights.

##### **Takeaways**

* Creative inspiration can come from various sources.
* Emotions play a crucial role in engaging audiences.
