App event optimization focuses on optimizing ad campaigns to drive high-value actions from users, such as purchases, sign-ups, or other meaningful engagements. By leveraging advanced algorithms and user behavior data, it ensures ads are shown to audiences most likely to convert, improving overall campaign efficiency.  
The AEO process begins with identifying key user actions that define value for the app. Campaigns are then structured to target users most likely to perform these actions, using historical data and predictive models. Regular monitoring and refinement ensure continued optimization as user behavior evolves.  
AEO helps reduce wasted ad spend by focusing on high-intent users, leading to better conversion rates and a higher return on investment (ROI). It also improves the overall quality of acquired users, ensuring they contribute more value over time.  
While ASO focuses on optimizing the app’s visibility and appeal in the app store, AEO complements it by bringing high-quality users directly to the app, creating a holistic acquisition strategy.

## What is App Event Optimization?

App Event Optimization (AEO) is a targeted marketing strategy in mobile games that focuses on specific in-app events, such as purchases or level completions, to drive higher user engagement, retention, and revenue. App Event Optimization (AEO) helps mobile game marketers to acquire high-quality users who are more likely to interact with the game, complete valuable actions, and make in-app purchases. Through AEO, marketers use tools like custom event setup and behavioral analytics to identify key user actions, personalize ad delivery, and maximize Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). This data-driven approach allows for fine-tuned campaign optimization, where each ad is tailored to attract users who align with the game’s revenue goals. By integrating App Store Optimization (ASO) and event-based advertising, AEO enhances discoverability and boosts both organic and paid user acquisition.

## How Does App Event Optimization Work?

App Event Optimization works through allowing you to find users who are more likely to complete a specific app event. You can choose from normal app events like “achieve level,” “tutorial completion,” “start trial,” and “buy” on Facebook.

That’s advantageous because you’re not simply collecting any consumers; you’re acquiring high-quality users who can be monetized.  
As you may be aware, many consumers download a mobile game, play it once or twice, and then delete it. By optimizing for the “achieve level” event, you can target players who are more inclined to engage with your game.

## What is the Process of Optimizing for App Events?

The process of optimizing for app events are as followed:

Assume you’ve achieved steps 0 and 1 and now want to concentrate on high-quality consumers and monetizing your mobile game, but you’re not sure when or how.

**Let’s start with the question of “when.”**

And don’t forget that step 0 (creative production) is never complete; you must always create new creatives. Furthermore, you must put those creatives to the test, which is an ongoing war in which you must constantly look for winning ideas (benchmark KPIs).

We arrived to a conclusion after trying a variety of tactics, scratching our brains, and reviewing the data. App event optimization will not produce adequate results if your ad account does not have enough App Installs for a given mobile game.

The algorithm only has enough data for a successful shift to **AEO** (App Event Optimization) campaigns after reaching roughly 10,000 app installs. I understand that this appears to be a large sum, but it is the reality of the mobile gaming market.

The good news is that if you get 10,000 users **by deploying winning creatives, your audience is relevant and aligned with your KPIs**.

## How to Create an App Events-Optimized Campaign?

To create an app events-optimized campaign, you must choose between ASBO and CBO once more.

I can only encourage you to do one thing in terms of GEOs, gender, age, placement, and so on, and that is data analysis.

Break down the data, research it, and come to a conclusion on what you need, what is a good KPI, and so on.

**Aim for a 5 million plus audience for AEO.** Do not target 1% of the audience in nations with populations of fewer than 70 million people. Instead, start with 3% of the whole audience.

**Select “Highest value of lowest cost” next to Campaign Bid Strategy on the Campaign level.**

You have Optimization for Ad Delivery all the way down on the ad set level, and if you’ve set up App Events inside your app, you’ll be able to choose between them.

Subscribe, Purchase, Achieve Level, and other App Events are some of the most common. Select the one for which you wish to optimize your campaign or ad set.

**You’ll be ready to start with App Event Optimization for your mobile game once you’ve uploaded the winning creatives into the ad set(s)**.

Keep a watch on the metrics for Results, Mobile App Purchase, and ROAS. Depending on which app event you chose, these will inform you how many conversions you had. The acronym ROAS stands for Return on Ad Spend, and it will show you exactly what it means. The value of conversions can be found in the “Purchases Conversion Value” column.

For the values of outcomes and ROAS, there is no magic number. Both are dependent on the figures you’ve calculated using your KPIs.

## What are the Benefits of App Event Optimization for Mobile Game?

The benefits of App Event Optimization for mobile games include acquiring higher-quality users who are more likely to engage with the game, maximizing Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) by targeting users inclined to perform valuable actions, and boosting retention rates by focusing on users likely to stay engaged. Additionally, AEO enhances monetization through in-app purchases, provides data-driven insights to refine campaigns, and reduces user churn by attracting a more loyal player base.

### Acquires Higher Quality Users

Higher-quality users are those who engage deeply with a mobile game, perform valuable in-app actions like purchases, and tend to remain active over time. By acquiring higher-quality users, App Event Optimization (AEO) benefits mobile games by driving more meaningful engagement, increasing the likelihood of in-app purchases, and ensuring that ad spend is directed toward users who add long-term value, ultimately boosting the game’s retention rates and revenue potential.

### Maximizes Return on Ad Spend

Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) is a key performance metric that measures the revenue generated for every dollar spent on advertising. Maximizing ROAS benefits App Event Optimization for mobile games by ensuring that ad budgets are focused on attracting high-value users who are more likely to engage in in-app events like purchases and level completions, ultimately boosting revenue and improving the efficiency of marketing spend.

### Boosts Retention Rates

Retention rates measure the percentage of users who continue to engage with a mobile game over a specific period. Boosting retention rates benefits App Event Optimization (AEO) by ensuring that the targeted users are not only high-quality but also more likely to stay engaged, interact with in-app events, and make repeat purchases. This sustained engagement supports long-term revenue growth and strengthens the game’s user base, making AEO campaigns more effective and yielding a higher return on investment.

### Enhances Monetization

Monetization in mobile games refers to the strategies used to generate revenue from user actions, such as in-app purchases or ads. Enhancing monetization rates benefits App Event Optimization (AEO) by focusing on high-value actions, allowing mobile game marketers to attract users more likely to spend within the game, ultimately increasing revenue and providing a higher Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). This optimized approach not only drives financial gains but also supports sustainable growth by fostering a user base that continually contributes to the game’s profitability.

### Gains Data-Driven Insights

Data-driven insights involve analyzing user behavior and in-app actions to make informed decisions for campaign optimization. By gaining data-driven insights, mobile game marketers can refine App Event Optimization by understanding which in-app events drive the most engagement and revenue, allowing them to target high-quality users, enhance ad relevance, and ultimately increase both retention rates and monetization.

### Reduces User Churn

User churn refers to the rate at which users stop engaging with a mobile game over a certain period. Reducing user churn benefits App Event Optimization by retaining a more loyal and engaged user base, which in turn improves overall campaign performance and return on ad spend (ROAS). When churn is minimized, fewer new users need to be acquired to maintain a stable player base, allowing marketers to focus on high-quality users who drive in-app events and generate long-term revenue.

## What is the Role of ASO in App Event Optimization for Mobile Games?

The role of App Store Optimization (ASO) in App Event Optimization (AEO) for mobile games is to enhance discoverability and drive organic traffic, which supports the acquisition of high-quality users who are likely to engage with in-app events. App Store Optimization for mobile games helps increase visibility by optimizing for keywords, app titles, and descriptions, leading to a higher ranking in app store searches. App Store Optimization attracts users who are genuinely interested in the game, making them more inclined to perform valuable in-app actions, such as level completions, purchases, or other events. As these high-quality users engage with these events, AEO strategies can further optimize campaign performance by targeting specific behaviors, refining ad spend, and boosting retention rates, ultimately maximizing return on investment (ROI).

When ASO and AEO are combined, they create a seamless approach that attracts and engages users effectively. ASO establishes a strong foundation by driving organic installs, which complements AEO’s focus on user retention and in-app engagement. Together, ASO and AEO foster a cycle of user acquisition and retention, where optimized app store listings draw users, and AEO strategies engage them within the game through tailored events. By tracking metrics like conversion rates and user loyalty, app marketers can further refine their campaigns, using insights from ASO and AEO to adjust advertising spend and personalize content. Ultimately, the integration of ASO within AEO strengthens the overall mobile game marketing strategy, aligning discoverability with long-term user engagement and revenue growth.
