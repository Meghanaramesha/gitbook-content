Floodrush is a unique blend of battle royale and Clash Royale-style unit placement, showcasing Supercell’s innovative approach to mobile game design. As players progress, their power and army size grow, reflecting a core gameplay mechanic that Supercell has iterated on across titles like Squad Busters. The game’s focus on player progression and strategic unit deployment creates an engaging experience, where mastering controls and tactics is essential to success. With Floodrush, Supercell continues to push the boundaries of mobile gaming by combining familiar elements with new dynamics, making it a standout title for both players and user acquisition strategies.

## What is the soft launch strategy for Supercell’s Floodrush, and how does it optimize game performance before global release?

Floodrush was soft-launched in English-speaking regions, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Singapore. Unlike Squad Busters, which was developed by one team at Supercell, Floodrush is created by a different development team within the company.

This game was soft-launched in English-speaking geos:

**US, UK, CA, NZ & SG**

This game is developed by a different CELL than [Squad Busters](https://lancaric.me/squad-busters-supercell-softlaunch/).

Let the Hunger Games begin! Only one game can survive, right?

Anyway, let’s get back to Supercell’s soft launch formula. Before we compare Squad Busters with Floodrush and their approach, let’s take a step back and look at what is possible on Android for [soft launching your game](https://lancaric.me/how-to-soft-launch-a-mobile-game-in-2022/). I took few slides from my last year’s presentation at DOF & Google with Nimrod.

In Pre-Launch, you **move gradually** from one test to another, **from Tech to Engagement, Monetization to Soft Launch testing**.

* In each step, you have **benchmarks** for **specific KPIs** that help you understand if the game shows potential
* If the game is **underperforming,** you have the **opportunity to improve** and continue testing

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-21.55.03.png)

Different Pre-Launch tracks to help developers test and optimize games before releasing globally.

* Each track has its own **benefits** and **limitations,** and you can easily control them in the **Play Console**
* The main idea behind these tracks is to help you test and optimize the game in a **safe environment**

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-21.55.26.png)

The **CLOSED BETA we saw with Squad Busters** is one of our most used features for testing mobile games**, especially for bigger game developers** or **those who work with a big IP.** This track:

* Allows developers to test their new game with an INVITE-ONLY COMMUNITY of users (**emails/100K** or **google groups/unlimited)**
* And these users **are able to provide private feedback** to developers both **before and after** the launch

**Important:** Although this track is commonly used by developers, they usually **also use** the other tracks **such as Open Beta and Limited Production,** in order to get more users & data and decrease the risk of issues during global launch.

**Please pay attention again to words – bigger game developers, big IP!!!!**

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-21.55.44.png)

**An extremely popular track** is a **more public track,** called **OPEN BETA (****Unreleased** **mark** in the store**)**.

* A game in open beta is **publicly discoverable** in-store – Users can **find & install** your game directly from your store listing (no invite needed).
* But while you can **distribute your game** to entire markets **like in Production Track** – users **CANNOT** **leave public ratings or reviews (****IMPORTANT****)**
* Another advantage is **install capping** for each market!

Usage:

* This track is very popular to test (1) **Tech Performance**, (2) **Engagement** and (3) **Monetization**. Usually in a **mix of GEOs** such as the Philippines and Nordics/Poland, United Kingdom/Germany, etc ..
* At this stage, you can also use **user acquisition** to direct users to the store listing!

## Why is user acquisition crucial for open beta games like Floodrush without established IPs?

User acquisition is crucial for open beta games like Floodrush without established IPs because it helps attract and engage players, driving downloads and user retention.

Soooo … When installing the game, I saw an ad in google play for FloodRush. See the difference? **Closed Beta = no UA (Squad Busters), Open Beta = UA** **(Floodrush)**

Flood rush feels very **not-supercell-ish**. If I didn’t know this is from Supercell, I wouldn’t say it is. Not sure if this is good or bad. But I know something for sure. **If you don’t use a Supercell IP, you need to run UA to get users!** And guess what? **They run UA for this open beta on Google & Facebook!**

Thank you [mobileaction](http://mobileaction.co) for providing the insights! The only tool where I found the creatives!

## How can varied creative concepts boost marketing performance in mobile game open betas?

## 

Diversifying creative concepts can significantly enhance marketing performance in mobile game open betas by attracting a broader audience, improving engagement, and increasing brand visibility.

It was a mix of static images & videos. You can get away with 10 creatives for a limited amount of time in the open beta f**rom May 29 – June 7.**

## 

I really like the “mass battles” scenes in the creatives. Next time please use at least 2-3 creative concepts and all the resolutions. You might get better marketing KPIs. I know that wasn’t the main goal for this open beta, but hey. **It won’t hurt!**

## Player Feedback

* *I absolutely hate the controls and camera scheme. The camera automatically rotates around as you move and is, to me, vomit-inducing. Also not a fan of tap-to-move + portrait mode. The whole point of portrait mode is one-handed play, but because you need to tap to move, you need two hands to play.*
* *Characters feel sluggish, similar to the failed Boom Beach Frontlines.*
* *The battles are very chaotic with so many units, and it’s hard to determine whether your unit selection has an impact.*
* **Overall just not fun (to me)**
* *Strange controls. Why not joystick? I’m in control of a single character after all.*
* *Minions were hard to understand: Their characteristics, behaviors and abilities were not obvious, and because there were so many of them at once it was difficult to observe what was going on. They’re not as orthogonal as Squad Busters.*  
  *The octopus is a shotgun unit apparently! Who would tell!? You need to go to a submenu to understand that!*
* *Gameplay felt slow and passive: Minions behave automatically and their positioning didn’t seem to react to my character movement, contrary to Squad Busters, so I couldn’t reposition them during combat.*
* *Despite the variety in maps, the pattern felt repetitive: Loot and then clash in the center. I didn’t feel there were many mechanics in the maps to master, contrary to League of Legends map monsters.*  
  *And because the maps change, it didn’t encourage mastery.*
* *Additionally, it’s quite challenging to understand what elements in the map are intractable/destroyable and which don’t… they all look the same. A barrel is destroyable but a box next to it that looks the same isn’t OK. The drops seem quite arbitrary as well.*  
  *If I understood correctly, the expected dynamics is to observe the opponents buildup, and then adapt yours consequently for the end clash.* *I think that’s cool but the range of options during the match to do this is fairly limited.*
* *Combat is not fun, or at least I felt they weren’t as fun as Squad Busters. Moving doesn’t move your troops or reposition them, there’s no tradeoff between moving and attacking. And skills are limited. So people just stands there until one dies.*
* *Battle Pass looks like a ship traveling through islands but this is unrelated to the islands of the gameplay. Confusing.*

We also asked our good friend [Javier Barnes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javier-barnes-8b0b5424/) & guess what:

## **Javier prefers** ***Squad Busters***

**I didn’t enjoy the** ***Floodrush*** **beta too much**.   
There are some interesting ideas in *Floodrush*. But I believe most of them – if not all – are currently executed way better in *Squad Busters*.

Among the reasons why I didn’t enjoy *Floodrush* are:

* **PVP combat is too passive and lacks enough skill factor.** The actions available (summon more troops, skill, item…) are limited and don’t seem capable of turning the tide. So whoever had the bigger army wins the combat. In *Squad Busters*, despite the fact that combat is also automatic, there is a layer of mastery around repositioning troops, and disengaging doesn’t cost you the match thanks to the option to sprint.
* **Team building is not as exciting as it could be.** This happens because unit choices happen less often and are not as impactful to gameplay as in *Squad Busters*. Additionally, players do not find each other early in the match, making the resource gathering process lack danger, and feel slow and boring.
* **The match structure is too simple and repetitive.** The main randomness is the spawn of chests and its quality, which is not enough to make matches feel truly different and interesting. In *Squad Busters*, the map has more elements triggering over the course of the match, gameplay modifiers, and unit choices change the gameplay a lot.
* **The match allows no comebacks.** Disengaging from an unsuccessful combat is extremely punishing and renders the player unable to rebuild their army. In *Squad Busters*, escaping from combat is fast and troop costs are dynamic to allow comebacks.

In my humble opinion, in its current state *Floodrush* lacks enough gameplay intensity to be mass appeal and competes too directly with *Squad Busters* to shine on its own.

**To succeed, Floodrush needs to take some steps back and rethink how to fulfill its promise of delivering a mobile-friendly RTS.**
