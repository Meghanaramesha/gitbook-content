High-value players, referred to as whales are users who spend significantly more on in-game purchases compared to average players. High-value players are crucial targets for retargeting campaigns to maximize monetization. Retargeting segments for whales can be crafted by analyzing their purchasing behavior, preferences and engagement patterns. Personalized campaigns with exclusive offers, premium rewards and unique content can increase whales’ spending. High-value players respond well to VIP programs providing them with early access to content and unique game perks. Retargeting such players with tailored experiences can enhance emotional loyalty and deepen engagement. Whales seek exclusive value propositions which makes personalized communication highly effective in driving further in-game spending.

### Players Close to Purchase

Players close to purchasing are users who exhibit behaviors indicating a strong intent to make an in-game purchase. Players close to purchasing are ideal for retargeting campaigns that aim to convert potential buyers into paying users. Retargeting segments for such players can be created by analyzing signals such as cart abandonment, browsing history and previous interactions with promotional offers. Personalized messages encouraging players to complete the purchase including limited-time discounts, can enhance conversion rates. Providing targeted reminders about items in their cart increases the likelihood of purchase. Exclusive incentives like early-bird discounts or special deals, can create urgency for players near the purchase stage. Retargeting campaigns focusing on players close to purchase should also highlight the immediate benefits of premium features, encouraging users to proceed.

### Churn-Risk Users

Churn-risk users are players who show signs of disengagement, indicating a likelihood of abandoning the game. Churn-risk users are a critical segment for retargeting campaigns designed to boost retention and monetization. Identifying churn-risk users involves analyzing behavioral data such as frequency of logins, participation in events and spending patterns. Personalized re-engagement messages that offer in-game incentives like exclusive rewards or limited-time bonuses, can motivate users to return. Retargeting campaigns focusing on nostalgic elements or favorite past activities can rekindle interest among churn-risk players. Highlighting new game features or updates that align with the player’s past preferences can create renewed excitement. Special loyalty programs designed for churn-risk users can encourage ongoing commitment by providing rewards for consistent activity.

### Social Sharers/influencers

Social sharers or influencers are users who actively promote a game or its content across social media platforms. Social sharers and influencers are valuable for retargeting campaigns aimed at boosting monetization and player acquisition. Retargeting segments can be built by analyzing social engagement metrics, sharing frequency and community influence. Personalized incentives such as exclusive game content or early access, can motivate social sharers to continue promoting the game. Providing unique referral codes can encourage influencers to generate new sign-ups, thereby enhancing user acquisition. Retargeting campaigns for influencers should emphasize their role in fostering community engagement and offer special status within the game. Recognition of influencers through in-game rewards or exclusive privileges helps strengthen loyalty and promotes further advocacy.

### Event-Driven Players

Event-driven players are individuals or users whose actions are triggered by in-game events, leading to dynamic engagement. Event-driven players are effectively used for retargeting segments of users by identifying player behaviors associated with key in-game events. Behavioral data collected from triggered events is utilized to create targeted user segments. Those segments are retargeted with personalized in-game offers or notifications aimed at increasing engagement. Personalized engagement prompts players to make in-app purchases, boosting monetization opportunities. Retargeting based on event-driven behaviors enhances the relevance of offers which leads to higher conversion rates. Optimized offers generate a positive experience for players, encouraging repeat transactions.
