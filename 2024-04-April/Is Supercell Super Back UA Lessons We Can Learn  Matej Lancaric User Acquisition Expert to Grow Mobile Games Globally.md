UA Mobile Growth Extraordinaire ·

Helping you stay 2.5 steps ahead of the games industry. Don't be too serious, except about UA.  
[Subscribe to my Brutally Honest newsletter!](https://lancaric.substack.com/)

Supercell, a powerhouse in mobile gaming, is making waves with its innovative user acquisition (UA) strategies and creative community-driven initiatives. As the company navigates its comeback, leveraging high-quality creator collaborations and fresh gameplay designs, it’s capturing the attention of gamers and industry experts alike. From groundbreaking games like Floodrush and Project RISE to the dynamic Supercell Make platform that empowers user-generated content, Supercell is redefining how mobile games grow and thrive. In this article, we’ll explore how Supercell’s latest approaches in UA, game design, and community engagement offer invaluable lessons for mobile game developers seeking to balance creativity, user retention, and global reach. Is Supercell truly back on top? Let’s find out.

Supercell’s remarkable comeback is marked by 200 million monthly active users across its iconic games like Clash of Clans and Brawl Stars and a significant revenue resurgence in 2024 after prior declines. This success stems from bold moves such as reevaluating loot box removal, introducing engaging features like Starr Drops, and fostering strategic partnerships like the collaboration with Chess.com. By embracing innovative UA strategies, leveraging creative storytelling, and expanding channels, Supercell has revitalized its player base and monetization efforts. Strategic hires and community-driven features further underscore its ability to balance creativity, engagement, and sustainable growth, solidifying its leadership in mobile gaming.Back in the day, Supercell ads were crazy. It really made you stop and think “how can a mobile game afford Liam Neeson?” Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, and Brawl Stars are all in the star-studded lineup of one of the most recognizable gaming developers in the world.

Their impact is undeniable. It was unthinkable to host esports tournaments for a mobile game. For devs and UA managers, their freemium model was an absolute game changer. It explains why the Clash franchise alone generated over $10B at one point. In comparison, Genshin Impact has generated $5.3 billion since September 2020.

Are they what they used to be? No. Definitely not. They’ve had plenty of dips in recent years. In 2022, they pulled out of Russia in response to the ongoing war in Ukraine, which was their 14th largest country by revenue ([$161 million in revenue](https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/03/22/supercell-block-access-to-games-russia-belarus-spring-2023)). And their removal of loot boxes was considered a failure. Overall, the mobile gaming landscape is changing – obviously. Competition is insane and players are more price sensitive. It’s easier to switch to a new game and try something else.

BUT—Supercell is making a pretty good comeback. In fact, it’s not Superdead at all. I want to discuss a few strategies for how they’re doing it.

How Did Supercell Achieve a Revenue Boom in 2024?
-------------------------------------------------

Supercell achieved a revenue boom in 2024 by leveraging a combination of engaging game launches, robust player retention strategies, and increased monetization efforts.

* 200 million monthly active users from 5 games: Hay Day, Clash of Clans, boom Beach, Clash Royale, Brawl Stars
* 68% of Clash of Clans users came via word of mouth, 15% from app store
* The last time Brawl Stars had a 12M net revenue week was May 2021. They hit 12M in Jan 2024.

**Revenue & Downloads**

* Weekly Downloads: 1-1.5m in 2020-2021
* Downloads drop by 50% in 2022-2023
* Weekly Revenue: 6-8m in 2021
* Weekly Revenue: 2-4m in 2022-2023
* Revenue in 2024? **BOOOOM**!

We kinda saw it quite early and talked about it on our no-bullshit gaming show. Have you seen it?

How Did Supercell Challenge Assumptions to Revive Brawl Stars Post-Loot Box Removal?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supercell Challenge Assumptions to Revive Brawl Stars Post-Loot Box Removal are as followed :

I’d like to start with this because it applies to every other lesson here. At the 2024 Games Developer Conference, General Manager Frank Keienburg at Supercell gave a presentation titled ‘Brawl Stars: Learnings from the Removal of Loot Boxes.” Out of all the insights that he shared, there was one that stood out.

> **“We were in an echo chamber and didn’t realize it.” – Frank Keienburg, GM at Supercell**

“We didn’t know what our players wanted,” he continued. This sat at the core of Supercell’s challenges, especially after the removal of loot boxes lead to week over week revenue drop without any signs of rebounding.

**This raises a ton of questions like: was it bad data? Or did they just not look at the data? How were decisions being made? What assumptions did they hold onto?**

As they threw away their roadmap for Brawl Stars, they decided to move forward with introducing new features that would improve engagement and challenge their own assumptions.

How Did Incremental Gameplay Features Help Supercell Revive Brawl Stars and Boost Player Engagement?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Incremental gameplay features helped Supercell revive Brawl Stars by introducing fresh mechanics, limited-time events, and seasonal updates that kept the game dynamic. These updates encouraged player retention, fostered community engagement, and reignited interest among both new and existing players, ultimately boosting long-term engagement.

Removing loot boxes altogether is a big, controversial decision. Youtubers and creators often attribute the ‘downfall of Supercell’ to this one decision alone. They didn’t listen to their audience – and made assumptions that there would be long-term gains from removing the gacha system.

The data indicated that it took about 10 months to unlock a legendary character for the most engaged users. The assumption was that it wasn’t rewarding enough, and they needed to give players more choices and goals.

While that may have been true, they quickly realized that they loved the excitement of random awards. Removing loot boxes sucked the fun out of the whole game. This insight led to a new and improved system, Starr Drops, which gives players randomized prizes for progressing through the game, and most importantly, reintroducing a gacha element.

***This, combined with re-engagement campaigns, helped kickstart their D30 player retention.***

Thanks to the expensive loot box lesson, Supercell started to introduce small new features to see if it would improve engagement. Starr Road’s progression became linear, which unlocked brawlers in succession in a predetermined order. Costume and player customization increased monetization for hardcore players, but not casual.

[*source: mobilegamer.biz*](https://mobilegamer.biz/supercell-explains-brawl-stars-big-comeback-from-an-all-time-low-to-8-8x-revenue/)

They introduced hypercharges, which are special moves that unlock when a player reaches max level, which incentivizes players to max out their characters. Ultimately, Brawl Stars grew MAU by 2.4x and DAU by 3.9x between June 2023 and February 2024, leading to 8.8x revenue growth.

Oh how I love graphs without Y-axis! But you can put it in the perspective a bit thanks to Sensor Tower!

Looks like a 10x now! FUCK YEAH! Kudos to the team

How Does Prioritizing Community Engagement Boost Player Retention and Revenue in Games Like Brawl Stars?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prioritizing community engagement boosts player retention and revenue in games like Brawl Stars by fostering a sense of belonging and loyalty. Interactive events, social media activities, and real-time feedback channels encourage players to stay invested, while active communities amplify word-of-mouth promotion and monetization opportunities.

They began to shit out a bunch of new content that encouraged social and community engagement. At the end of the day, socialization increases retention, engagement, and even revenue. Playing with friends is a way to socialize, but also remain competitive – and adds an incentive to progress in the game.They introduced the highly popular and chaotic 5v5 Brawl Ball mode that brought in extra flavor to the game. They run community events that reward the entire community if a collective challenge is complete. For example, 100 free Starr Drops for everyone if the community [collects 1.5 billion Rare Starr Drops](https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/blog/community/100starrdrops-community-event/).

More social quests were added that rewarded players who play consecutive games with friends. And lastly, they added a win streak mechanic that allows users to win more rewards based on their win streak. It encourages players to peacock, and flaunt their max win streak, which players often share with their friends, similarly to Fortnite crowns.

How Did Supercell Use Strategic Partnerships with Chess.com to Revive Clash Royale’s Community?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supercell’s partnership with Chess.com revived Clash Royale’s community by blending strategic gameplay elements with competitive events inspired by chess. This collaboration introduced fresh challenges, appealed to strategy enthusiasts, and attracted new players, fostering renewed interest and engagement within the game’s ecosystem.

In a presentation at RovioCon 23, Supercell’s head of marketing, Iwo Zakowski, furthered the idea of community – but with a different solution. The ex-Burger King exec highlighted Clash Royale’s reputation of having a toxic community.

They [partnered with Chess.com,](https://www.chess.com/news/view/clash-joins-chess-com) which was exploding at the time. Identifying them as a relevant partner with a positive fanbase, they introduced:

* Clash bots to play against on Chess.com
* Clash-inspired chess variant called Spell Chess
* A 16-player creator event called Chess Clash
* Three weekly Clash Royale vs Clash of Clans Arenas
* Two new clubs for Clash fans to join: Barbarian and King

Through this month-long campaign, they drove over 1 million new users and turned the tide against a toxic community, and built a new, more welcoming and positive one.

How Did Supercell’s Strategic Hires and Startup-Like Model Drive Innovation in 2023?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supercell’s strategic hires and startup-like model drove innovation in 2023 by fostering a culture of creativity and autonomy. The company brought in talent with diverse expertise, empowering small, agile teams to experiment and develop fresh, groundbreaking ideas. This decentralized approach allowed for quicker decision-making, leading to successful game updates and new titles that resonated with players.

Our friend, Ken Landen, attributes many of Supercell’s new ideas to new superstar hires, which proves to be one of the best ways to destroy your echo chamber. Supercell made some significant changes in 2023 that led to two new studios led by:

* Game lead **Maya Kylmamaa** — former Riot Games senior software engineer and technical lead for *League of Legends*, who also worked at Blizzard, DICE, and Lionhead Studios;
* Game engineer **Kevin J Bray** — former Riot Games developer, who also served as executive director of Tonk Tonk Games;
* Principal game designer **Candace Thomas** — former Riot Games senior manager and lead game designer, who also worked at Blizzard for 11 years (on *World of Warcraft* and *Diablo franchises*);
* Art lead **Charles Lee** — former Riot Games artist, who contributed to the Arcane series and worked at Blizzard, EA, and Obsidian Entertainment.

* Game lead **Steve Desilets** — former Amazon and Electronic Arts creative director, who also worked at Zynga and Valve;
* Lead artist **Matt Mocarski** — an experienced artist who worked at companies like King, Blizzard, Crystal Dynamics, Amazon, and NCSoft.

This also led to Supercell changing how their company operates – treating new games and teams as startups that are given unlimited creative freedom, but with a limited budget. New games that acquire the most users and find a market fit using Supercell’s proprietary engine and Unity or Unreal, enter the next scaling phase called “Scaleup.” All games who don’t meet that growth threshold are killed early without wasting any additional resources, reducing the risk while upping the reward for teams working on new games.

How Does Supercell Avoid Short-Term Revenue Pitfalls While Sustaining Long-Term Player Engagement?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supercell avoids short-term revenue pitfalls by focusing on sustainable, player-centric monetization strategies. They prioritize long-term player engagement through regular content updates, fair in-game purchases, and a balance between free and premium features. This approach fosters loyalty and retention, ensuring steady revenue growth without sacrificing player trust or satisfaction.

Supercell’s iterative approach to introducing new mechanics, content, and features focuses on the long-term gain of their game. While it may be tempting to spike revenue through in-game discounts, you’re ultimately going to face the hangover effect; or when a spike in revenue is followed by a valley in revenue because players are playing the game without spending any money. 

To combat this, Supercell is constantly ensuring they’re not cannibalizing their audience or inflating their currency. They’re consistently introducing new content that incentivizes players to spend in different ways. And discounts are consistent enough that no players are paying full-price for gems or items, which in itself is a price anchoring technique that makes players feel that they’re getting cut a good deal (and thus make more purchases).

What Can We Learn from Supercell’s New Brawl Stars UA and Creative Strategy in 2024?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supercell’s new Brawl Stars user acquisition (UA) and creative strategy in 2024 highlights the importance of data-driven insights, personalized ads, and community-centric messaging. By tailoring creatives to resonate with different player segments and focusing on in-game moments that showcase the game’s evolving features, Supercell effectively attracts and retains players, increasing both engagement and conversions.

I have a feeling the UA team of Supercell is listening now. They are expanding outside the “brand” & Supercell bullsh-IP-ish UA activities. In our Brawl starts to the moon episode we touched quickly what they could be doing in terms of UA and creatives and oh my god, what a change. No more organics only!

Yeah, I know. It’s not because of [two & a half gamers episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIPb2gKeFiw), but thanks to their amazing growth. But you never know .. you never know .. Anyway!

**Creatives? Check them out:**

* hooks
* story driven
* hypercasual (day1 vs day30 progression)
* gameplay cuts with story
* longform videos (30s+)
* playables!

**UA channels? Spoiler alert, its not only Google anymore. Check them out:**

I love this new Supercell! Games are getting softlaunched too ..

What can Supercell’s non-US soft launch of Squad Busters teach us about their user acquisition strategy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supercell’s non-US soft launch of Squad Busters teaches us the value of market testing and iterative optimization in user acquisition (UA). By starting in regions with diverse player behaviors, Supercell was able to fine-tune gameplay, monetization, and user acquisition tactics before scaling globally. This approach ensures that they build a solid foundation for player retention and revenue growth based on real-world feedback.

Yay! I am actually really excited here. Will be playing again and taking a closer look at their UA strategy.

I’ve also talked about different Supercell games in the softlaunch / closed beta:
