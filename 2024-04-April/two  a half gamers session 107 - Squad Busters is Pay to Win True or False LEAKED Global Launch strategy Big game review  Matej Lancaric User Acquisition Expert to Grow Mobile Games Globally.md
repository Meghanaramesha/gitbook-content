**Takeaways**

* Squadbusters has undergone significant changes between beta builds, including the introduction of a new gacha system and character progression through shards.
* The game features mega units that are consumable and have powerful stats, adding a pay-to-win element.
* The Battleback feature allows players to open chests and upgrade characters using consumables.
* The Beach World introduces new maps, units, and mods, and the Squad Journey provides a progression path for players.
* The hosts express excitement about the game but question the impact of certain features on the competitive Supercell community. The hosts enjoy playing Squad Busters but highlight issues with PvP battles, such as lack of readability and incentive.
* The game’s monetization system, including the gacha system, is praised, but the PvP win condition needs improvement.
* The potential impact of Squad Busters’ global launch on other Supercell games, particularly Brawl Stars, is discussed.
* The conversation explores the game’s ad strategy, including the use of content creators and potential ad placements. Squad Busters has the potential to be a successful game, given Supercell’s track record and the similarities between Squad Busters and their other games.
* The game’s target audience is likely to be different from that of Brawl Stars, with Squad Busters appealing to a more casual and approachable player base.
* Monetization strategies should be tailored to the Asian market, as pay-to-win mechanics are more accepted and successful in that region.
* Influencer marketing, particularly on platforms like TikTok, can be a powerful tool for promoting Squad Busters.
* Advertising channels such as TikTok, AppLovin, Google, and Facebook should be utilized to reach a wide audience.
* Creative concepts for advertising should focus on storytelling, showcasing characters and progression, and incorporating humor.
* Soft launches can provide valuable feedback and data, but given Supercell’s expertise and the similarities to their other games, a soft launch may not be necessary for Squad Busters.
* Supercell’s strong retention rates and high day 30 percentages indicate the potential for long-term success with Squad Busters.
* The success of Squad Busters will ultimately depend on the execution of marketing strategies and the quality of the game itself.
