The player has to attack monsters and maintain a winning streak to determine their level-up outcome and gaming. The game includes **attack, defense, upgrades, streak, and equipment.** As soon as the player enters the game, they are directed to the main battlefield where they are shown a brief tutorial about how to navigate the snake, how to attack, what diminishes its health, and what kills it

On March 18th, 2023, Habby, the company behind ***Archero*** and ***Survivor.io*** global launched another bullet from their hit making machine called ***SSSnaker***. If you have been following their portfolio you could see a clear pattern to their success, which is also why they were able to be successful with **[*Survivor.io.*](https://lancaric.me/survivor-io-global-launch-ua-case-study/)**

Yeah, exactly. We have been talking about the hybrid casual approach from Habby for a while. Check our podcast about survivor.io below:

**Survivor.io global launch on two & a half gamers podcast**
------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s look at UA, Ad monetisation & dive deep into Habby’s metagame framework.

What factors drive user acquisition and revenue for SSSnaker?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The factors that drive User acquisition and revenue for SSSnaker are as followed : 

When we discussed the Top 10 revenue countries on the podcast, Taiwan was on the top spot with US on the second and South Korea third. But that changed in the last few days.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-05-at-21.55.59-1024x311.png)

This is only in-app revenue. As Felix calculated, they make an additional 40% ad revenue on top of what we see. SSSnaker peaked at $187k in IAPs and decreasing slowly now. Game made $120k/day in 4 days after the global launch. [Survivor.io](https://lancaric.me/survivor-io-global-launch-ua-case-study/) was already making $240k/day 4 days after global. Feels like this game won’t be anywhere close to the success of [Survivor.io](https://lancaric.me/ua-creative-strategy-user-acquisition/). Still very very very interesting case!

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-05-at-22.00.08-1024x587.png)

When global launching a game, it’s important to have a full team on the UA, analytics, and creative team. Habby has everything, especially a very good creative team. But what happens before the global launch? **A Soft launch!**

How did SSSnaker’s soft launch strategy evolve across different regions and contribute to its initial user acquisition?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SSSnaker’s soft launch strategy evolve across different regions and contribute to its initial user acquisition are as followed : 

Looks like they softlaunched the game last year in February 2022 in Italy, France and Germany. Not that much was happening, they pushed new version out in October 2022, run some UA added UK into the mix, made few hundred dollars. Then again, new build live in November, same thing.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-05-at-22.08.01-1024x215.png)  
![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-05-at-22.06.10-1024x362.png)

Nothing unusual. Until January 2023 when they added Indonesia and Phillipines to run som tech tests (I would assume) and added Canada & Australia.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-05-at-22.07.05-1024x362.png)

What Is the Best User Acquisition Channel Mix for the Global Launch of SSSnaker?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The best user acquisition (UA) channel mix for the global launch of SSSnaker is given bellow : 

Surprising things here little bit. They are running everything out there, even Twitter!

Looks like the biggest channel is Ironsource, then Google (well, youtube especially) then Unity.

**But when we look more closely, on Apple the biggest network is Applovin + Google.**

**Ironsource**is the biggest channel in terms of spending on Android.

**Applovin** is the biggest spender on iOS.

* We can see both videos and playables in their creative mix. Again playable has the most share of impressions!

**Google**

* They started scaling on Youtube. Very big on iOS.
* Using mainly long-form 30+ second videos + some static images.

**TikTok**

* hah, not as big as TikTok spend with survivor!

**Unity**

* Started relatively big, especially on Android.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-05-at-22.17.26.png)

Where do they spend the most currently?

What creative strategies did SSSnaker use in its global launch to enhance user engagement?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The creative strategies that SSSnaker used in its global launch to enhance user engagement are given below : 

OMFG! Soooooo many different creatives. Let’s go over them one by one. Love it! So many different twists to the creative concepts. Looking into the [Mobile action ads gallery](https://www.mobileaction.co/app-ad-intelligence/#creative-analysis) for a creative research. These are the types of creatives they run:

**UGC**

**Altered gameplay**

**Hypercasual**

**Mass battles**

**classic gameplay**

**EDM music with mass/altered  gameplay**

**Creative examples – UGC!**
----------------------------

https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/UGC2.mp4  
https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ugc3.mp4  
https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/UGC1-sssnaker.mp4  
https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fake-AI-UGC-4.mp4

Wait a second. The last UGC video feels different and little bit weird. Hmm, but there is more of that …

https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fake-AI-UGC-2.mp4  
https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fake-AI-UGC3.mp4

Yeah, I know what this is—high efficiency and creativity. These last three videos are made with AI-generated people. Can you see a difference? I spotted this right away since I use this as well in some of the videos we produced. AI-generated “UGC content” perform on pair with “real” people. Good luck, influencers!

**Creative exapmples – Mass Battles**
-------------------------------------

https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mass-battles.mp4  
https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mass-battles-3.mp4  
https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mass-battles-2.mp4  
https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mass-battles-4.mp4

Mass battles are my favorite concepts. I used them in many of the games I ran before. It always works great!

**More creative examples**

What is difference between SSSnaker’s user acquisition strategies and survivor.io’s creative execution?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main difference is SSSnaker’s user acquisition strategies are not as excited on the UA side as with survivor.io, although the creative concepts are fucking amazing!

Not as excited on the UA side as with survivor.io, although the creative concepts are fucking amazing!

Lots of different takes on altered gameplay and even hypercasual mechanics. Lots of emojis, music, subtitles, TikTok voice + AI generated people are used in the creatives.

Good job!

How does SSSnaker’s ad monetization strategy compare to Survivor.io’s rewarded ad placements?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SSSnaker’s ad monetization strategy as compared to Survivor.io’s rewarded ad placements 

SSSnaker has a very similar ad monetization strategy compared to Survivor.io which we discussed in detail on [#31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mowIJKtG1M8&t=1985s&ab_channel=two%26ahalfgamers) of 2.5 Gamers below. In total, there are six rewarded ad placements inside of SSSnaker. Four ad placements are visible as part of the FTUE with another two placements that become visible after completing the first world.

How do rewarded ad placements in SSSnaker improve player engagement and retention?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rewarded ad placements in SSSnaker improve player engagement and retention are given below :

As part of the store SSSnaker has **4 Rewarded Ad placements**. One rewarded ad opens **a Normal Box** that’s on a five hour cool down timer. The second rewarded ad unit opens **a Super Box** which on a 4 day cool down timer. The third is a **20 gems for free** Rewarded ad placement on a 2 hour cool down. Last but not least there’s a **dynamic ad placement for gold** where users are encouraged to click for free gold to earn more gold by watching a Rewarded ad for even more free Gold.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SSSnaker-Ad-Monetization-Strategy-Google-Docs.png)  
![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SSSnaker-Ad-Monetization-Strategy-Google-Docs-1.png)

That means as part of the **FTUE the max amount of Rewarded ads a user can watch is 4 RV impressions**. Once a player reaches the second world two more Rewarded Ad placements become visible for the user. One placement is a rewarded ad placement for revival which I suspect is the most popular ad placement in the game as you tend to die quite a lot in this game.

The second rewarded ad placement that becomes visible at the start of the second world is a **quick earnings booster** which allows you to earn rewards for watching a rewarded ad.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SSSnaker-Ad-Monetization-Strategy-Google-Docs-2.png)

**40% Ads revenue ($65k/day)**
------------------------------

In total that means that by the second world a user can watch 6+ Rewarded placements depending on how many times users choose to revive themselves in the main game play. If we combine the FTUE IMP/DAU along with the IMP/DAU after the first world in my experience we’re looking at an average **IMP/DAU of 3.8 with an ad viewer rate of 65%**. Taking the average eCPMs for rewarded videos for the same time period and combining it with SSSnakers active user base that gets an ad revenue of around **$65k/day.** Meaning that about 40% of SSSnakers total revenue comes from Rewarded Ads.

**Habby – the hybrid-casual hit making machine**
------------------------------------------------

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-05-at-22.51.11-1024x344.png)

Last year (2022) September-October were **the** best months for the whole company. Making whooping **37 Million USD/month**. This is only IAP revenue and based on our assumptions (and calculations), they could be making **40-50% more on Ad revenue**. Survivor.io being the biggest hit so far. We also recorded a podcast about their recent global launch of SSSnaker:

In today’s mobile F2P gaming market, where (unfortunately) **99% of games** fail or don’t reach enough scale to be profitable, the key is to have **multiple shots on goal** at a fast frequency. Looking at their strategy, there are two key elements they use – Unfolding gameplay and metagame framework. Let’s look at the first one now – the **Unfolding gameplay**.

You can quickly see the principles behind this browser games, [paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/) where you will be first making innocent paperclips, and then a few hours later, you will be destroying the galaxy

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs.png)

**The Unfolding gameplay**
--------------------------

After they found their first success with ***Archero*** they have been perfecting this setup to this day, as we can see looking at their newest game. Not all games on their portfolio follow these patterns, so we are gonna explicitly look at ***Archero, Survivor.io, Punball, Kinja Run,*** and **SSSnaker.**

After the initial install, these games all look like **hyper-casual games**. They all strictly follow the rule of **one button control** in the form of a joystick, which controls the player’s character. You are immediately thrown into gameplay action, which is intuitive to control and get immediate enjoyment. After your initial run, you are taken to the main menu, and you upgrade your character through the **passive system,** the **only unlocked system** at that time.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs-1.png)

As seen in the screenshots, at this stage the game looks very simple, even though we can expect some more systems under the locked icons. Player then continues the main loop and the situation repeats. At some point the game unlocks **equipment inventory** and slowly drops more and more features on the player. But we are talking multiple days of sessions, not your usual **20 minutes tutorial** which unlocks the whole UI on you afterwards.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs-2.png)

Below we can see how the UI is slowly filling with more and more features and systems. You can see how my ***SSSnaker*** has progressed after a few days, but I still **haven’t unlocked all of the main features** that the game has to offer. On the other hand, here is my ***Survivor.io*** account which is pretty much fully **unfolded** compared to its initial stage we have seen here before. Another example is seen with the Punball progressed account.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs-3.png)

This process makes sure that the player’s attention **slowly shifts** from mastering the core gameplay into **RPG progression** of his character. In the end you are upgrading **multiple systems** and playing **different game modes** to get more power into your character and move onto the next stage. On the UI below we can clearly see that this is not anymore the hypercasual game we have started with. It morphed into a very heavy IAP driven **Roguelite ARPG**.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs-4.png)  
![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs-5.png)

This enables Habby to widen the **UA funnel** getting hypercasual-like reach and CPIs. This principle is an upgrade to the usual **hypercasual pipeline** where small studios send prototypes to the publisher, which then tests the KPIs and picks the ones with the best metrics, and then pushes them with UA. Habby not only does this, but they actively **change the feature pacing** of these prototypes to fit their unfolding gameplay formula. They slot the core gameplay into their **metagame framework,** which is a tried and tested progression of a rogue-lite Action RPG. Let’s look into detail how this transformation works. ***SSSnaker*** was published by Habby but developed by Yiduo Games under the former name of ***Snake Master.***

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs-6.png)

You can play the game through an old [build APK](https://apksos.com/app/com.lark.snake.fire) on Android if you want to see the differences for yourself!

The first big difference is the **equipment progression.** In the original game there is just a simple upgrade sink compared to the 6 slot equipment gacha which is one of the main pillars of the metagame framework. It is presented in every one of these games.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs-7.png)

***Survivor.io*** even went so far that they doubled the inventory right after global launch, probably to immediately get more **spend depth** into the game as they saw the amazing global launch numbers.Same gacha system progression applies also here.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs-8.png)

In the first session of ***Snake Master,*** you could already select a different snake with different rarities to collect. In ***SSSnaker*** this feature is unlocked somewhere around day 4 if you play a lot. This was changed to fit the **unfolding formula** as RPG elements are pushed for later in order for players to focus on **mastering core gameplay**.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs-9.png)

Another staple of the framework is the **idle generation mechanic**. Not only does it incentivize sessions, but it further **reinforces the roguelite nature** of the gameplay. Progression of roguelite games is based on the principle that even though you always start your new run from **level 1 character** you get resources into permanent upgrades that carry over between the runs. As the game is based around Player versus environment difficulty, this assures that **eventually you progress** even in chapters you are stuck in or can’t deal with the mechanics. Your stats grow so high that the content that was hard to get through will eventually **become easy** with your permanent upgrades. This makes for a very approachable and “casual” progression.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs-10.png)

As seen on the big UI layout of Survivor.io image we have shown before the monetization and live-ops systems are the last to unlock in their full force with all the battle passes, achievements, subscriptions, daily quests, daily rewards, piggy banks, offer systems and event systems.These are again universal for the whole **framework**.

All of these progression layers such as talents, equipment, additional hero characters create very deep **IAP** and **Ad** economy **spend depth** that is similar to a **midcore RPG**.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Habby-The-hit-making-machine-Final-Google-Docs-11.png)

This whole process enables Habby to focus on their **metagame** **framework**, improving even the older games as it is compatible. In the meantime they continue testing  prototypes of **different core gameplays** from different studios to get the best KPIs to slot into their framework and keep up with their very fast release frequency fueling the “hit machine” and getting multiple shots on goal. You could say that Habby are the true masters of **“HybridCasual”**.
