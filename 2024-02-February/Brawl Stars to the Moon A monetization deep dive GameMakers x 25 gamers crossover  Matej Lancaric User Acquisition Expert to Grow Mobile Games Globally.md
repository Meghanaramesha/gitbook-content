**Summary**  
In this episode, the hosts discuss the recent surge in popularity and revenue of the mobile game Brawl Stars. They analyze the game’s performance, product features, and monetization strategies. The introduction provides background information on the guests and sets the stage for the discussion. The chapters cover topics such as the game’s performance, gameplay mechanics, the introduction of the Brawl Pass, and the impact of hypercharges on progression and monetization. Overall, the conversation highlights the success and strategic decisions behind Brawl Stars’ recent growth. Brawl Stars has a unique monetization strategy with a focus on limited-time offers and tiered purchases. The game introduces luck mechanics and discounted offers to incentivize player spending. The addition of social features like 5v5 game modes and community events enhances player engagement. Brawl Stars is also experimenting with ad tech and rewarded videos to generate additional revenue. However, there are areas for improvement, such as optimizing offers and personalization, refining event structure, and increasing the frequency of season quests. The game’s user acquisition strategy primarily relies on organic growth and influencer marketing, but there is potential for further expansion in UA efforts. Brawl Stars has experienced a recent spike in revenue, which can be attributed to various factors such as new sales, structural changes, and key hires. The game has made significant live ops changes, including expanding the team and delivering more content. However, the speed of scaling up the team may be a challenge. Looking ahead, there is a positive outlook for Brawl Stars, with expectations of an elevated baseline revenue. The introduction of new spend depth, optimization of offers, and potential integration of ads contribute to this positive outlook.

The success of a game often depends on factors such as gameplay mechanics, updates, and the target audience.  
Developers should consider diversifying their portfolio and exploring new genres to avoid cannibalizing their own games.  
The performance of games can vary greatly, even within the same company or genre.
