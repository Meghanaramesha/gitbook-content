UA Mobile Growth Extraordinaire ·

Helping you stay 2.5 steps ahead of the games industry. Don't be too serious, except about UA.

Duolingo’s user acquisition strategy on TikTok is a game-changer in the world of mobile UA. By mastering TikTok’s algorithm, the brand has tapped into viral trends, creative humor, and highly engaging content to boost app downloads and daily active users (DAU). This innovative approach leverages key entities such as TikTok’s recommendation system, engagement metrics, and Duolingo’s viral marketing campaigns to drive both immediate user growth and long-term retention.

Duolingo’s approach to TikTok User Acquisition combines controlled controversy—joking within socially acceptable boundaries to spark engagement—while staying edgy yet non-offensive. They excel at leveraging trending formats and sounds, understanding TikTok’s dynamic content ecosystem, and adapting quickly to viral opportunities. Using Gary V’s “jab, jab, jab, right hook” strategy, they focus 80% on entertaining and relatable content, reserving 20% for promotions, thereby earning audience trust before asking for conversions.

In this article, we’ll explore how Duolingo’s use of TikTok, from crafting relatable content to optimizing for retention metrics like streaks and notifications, sets a new standard for mobile app growth strategies.

Whether you’re looking to adapt these insights for your own app or understand the role of platforms like TikTok in reimagining user acquisition, this guide provides effective tactics for success.

How did Duolingo’s TikTok strategy turn the green bird into a viral sensation?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Duolingo’s TikTok strategy turned the green bird into a viral sensation by adapting to a more edgy, humorous approach to content creation.If you aren’t on TikTok, you probably have no idea why or how the green bird became the most loved menace on the platform.

To set the stage here, the language learning app went public and was valued at $6.5B in July 2021. Although they started posting TikToks in February of that same year, they started getting edgier around May – just two months before one of the biggest days for the company.

**That’s what makes this story special. Today they have 8.8m+ followers and 189.2M+ total likes on their videos.** A year before their investment in TikTok, they were running TV ads that just weren’t driving any ROI, so they looked elsewhere.

The top comment on their TV Ad!

Boring and ineffective TV campaigns. Let’s try to change that?!

How has Duolingo’s TikTok strategy enhanced mobile user acquisition (UA)?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Duolingo’s TikTok strategy has boosted mobile user acquisition (UA) by using its mascot, Duo, to create humorous, relatable content that deeply engages users.Just like Wendy’s vastly popular Twitter account circa 2017, Duolingo took TikTok by storm with a very similar approach…but even crazier.

The premise basically is that their green bird mascot, Duo, will do whatever it takes to remind you to do your daily Duolingo exercises. Whether that’s by threatening you or simping on your favorite K-pop idols with you.

People on TikTok ate it up. I mean, it’s genuinely hilarious.

They’re so comfortable in their own skin that they openly roast other brands, their own followers, and celebrities. While they make it feel completely effortless, there’s a lot of work that goes into each and every video.

How Does Duolingo Balance Paid and Organic Mobile User Acquisition (UA) to Drive Growth?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Duolingo balances paid and organic mobile user acquisition (UA) by allocating roughly half of its marketing budget to each. According to their CMO, they still spend almost [half of their marketing budget on paid UA](http://lancaric.me) and the other half on producing organic content. **TV is almost completely scaled back and replaced by TikTok videos**, except in high-performing markets like Brazil and Japan.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F250908e4-73f0-458c-9c82-92ced1a06b25_669x1099.png)

But how did it start? They hired a Gen-Z TikTok fanatic, **Zaria Parvez**, to run the show. It was her first job out of college she envisioned a new personality for the once-whole owl. She pitched the idea to get the Owl to twerk on a conference room table and it was a massive hit – the rest is history.

They tested a random idea, validated it, and ran with it. The timing was everything. In an interview with Silicon Republic, she attributes her success to calculated risks.

> “At Duolingo, we have this concept called calculated risk, which is all about consciously bold decisions that marry intention with impact. I think it’s really important to have this mindset of taking a calculated risk, because it brings up the safeguards and the spaces for you to take risks without overstepping the line or messing up too badly.”

What makes Duolingo’s mobile user acquisition strategy so effective on social media?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Duolingo’s mobile user acquisition strategy succeeds on social media due to its unique blend of humor, timely content, and “controlled controversy.”Brands have tried and failed to emulate Duolingo’s magic. While most of them look like boring corporate accounts or straight-up cringe, I’ve tried my best to distill the criteria of what sets them apart from the rest.

### Master controlled controversy

Duolingo very rarely crosses the line on offensive content. The only time they really had to apologize was for a silly comment about Amber Heard during the Johnny Depp trials (but everyone sided with Duo anyway).

The edgier stuff is mostly self-deprecating, but they’re in tune with what’s okay to joke about and what’s not. This strategy is called ‘controlled controversy,’ where you share your opinions or joke about subjects that have little to no political affiliation or morality.

Think about the Kardashians who continuously put out “*harmless”* PR stunts to maintain their relevance (minus the s\*x tape). The controlled controversy is more like that time Kim created a ‘media moment’ by paying someone to throw flour on her at the red carpet. Or DJ Khaled proposing to Nicki Minaj on MTV.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2704e1d-6a94-48b6-b6bc-94af94b24aaf_600x600.png)

### Understand trending formats and sounds

There are so many unspoken signals to a successful TikTok. The way they’re paced, the way they sound, the lighting, camera angles, and even where the captions are on the screen. If you’re in the weeds of TikTok, you’ll see that trends emerge every waking moment. Whether it’s a memey carousel or a terrible capcut edit, you need to be on top of what’s trending, because TikTok will push that content heavily.

### Jab jab jab, right hook strategy

Focus on building an audience first – the selling will come later. Washed-up social media guru Gary V coined the idea jab, jab, jab, right hook. He essentially says to deliver value (entertain, educate, inspire, or delight) for free consistently over time to build and serve a loyal audience. Once you earn their trust, you can ask for something in return (like downloading your app).

Duolingo’s team dedicates 80% of the time generating entertaining ideas while 20% of the time is reserved for scheduled promotional campaigns.

### Take risks and move fast

Content is consumed so fucking fast today that you might have a golden opportunity to react to something and it’ll be gone if you’re dwelling too long on it. Someone might make a video about your brand, or mention you in a comment, or your competitor might be going viral. Whatever that opportunity is, make sure you’re always monitoring your niche and ready to be quippy in your responses.

### Be absurdist

Because of how fast everything moves, Gen Z humor does, too. Gen Z and Gen Alpha memes are so far removed from the original joke that the humor is the absurdism, like what RyanAir is doing here.

> We love stuffed crust >
>
> [♬ original sound - Ryanair](https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7322885568101747489?refer=embed "♬ original sound - Ryanair")

Learning the lingo is hard (sorry Boomers), so sometimes it’s best to hire someone who knows and understands the ethos of TikTok (maybe ask your nephew). It should come as naturally as RyanAir’s profile description.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f1bda47-b555-4717-bb89-498af73f4ecc_452x277.png)

### Be thematic

While it’s funny to be unpredictable in the variety of your content, it pays to be predictable as well. Duolingo has a running theme of Duo attacking and threatening people to continue their streaks.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54431db0-50ff-45ef-9aed-5f011ce10343_509x199.png)

Some brands have a consistent look or format that is predictable but executed in a fresh way. There needs to be a uniformity and familiarity to your content to start building recognition in the long-run. If you’re just starting out, you’ll have to experiment with a ton of different formats and your audience will validate the themes for you.
