**Takeaways:**  
Implementing incentives for direct consumer channels can drive engagement, reward loyalty, and increase retention.  
Designing loyalty programs that offer a variety of discounts, time-based offers, loyalty tiers, and exclusive content can enhance the overall user experience.  
Driving traffic to web shops can be achieved through effective search engine optimization, on-page SEO, and conversion optimization.  
Creating well-made web shops involves providing a frictionless user experience, seamless account linking, and a focus on enhancing the game experience.  
Stash aims to be a white label experience that helps game developers own the customer relationship and avoid platform intermediation.  
The future of Stash lies in providing excellent experiences and giving game developers the freedom to switch platforms if desired.
