**Summary**  
In this conversation, Jakub, Matej, and Felix discuss the hyper-casual and hybrid-casual games developed by Superb, a South Korean company. They focus on three games: Pizza Ready, Outlet’s Rush, and Snake Clash. The hosts highlight the iterative nature of Superb’s games, with each new release improving upon the previous one. They also discuss the similarities between the games and the use of familiar mechanics and features. The hosts note the success of Superb’s games, with millions of downloads and significant revenue. They also mention the importance of CPI (cost per install) in the hyper-casual genre and the potential for further expansion and innovation in the future. The conversation explores the aggressive ad monetization strategies employed by SuperSense in their games Pizza Ready and Outlet Rush. The games heavily rely on ad revenue, with IAP revenue being a low percentage. The discussion delves into the use of rewarded video placements, interstitial ads, banner ads, and in-app open ads. It also uncovers the controversial practice of using players’ devices as a botnet for data scraping. The conversation raises questions about the ethics and profitability of such strategies. Overall, the ad monetization in these games is deemed aggressive, but effective. In this final part of the conversation, the hosts discuss the aggressive and creative use of branded ads in hypercasual games. They mention games like Outlast Rush and Pizza Ready, which earn close to 9 million per month and speculate on the amount spent on user acquisition. They also explore the use of famous logos and brands in game ads, such as Gucci, Chanel, and Nike. The hosts discuss the legality and effectiveness of these ads and share their thoughts on the Snake UA game. They also provide tips and tricks for emulator users and mention upcoming episodes and events.
