**Soft Launching a Mobile Game Ad Mon Perspective**

What prompted me to want to talk about this is a Statisa article Mobile Game ad spend is expected to grow to $130bn by 2025. That’s up 300% from $32 bn in 2020 With this amount of money being pumped into UA its safe to say Mobile ad revenue will only grow and be a larger part of your overall revenue for mobile games I wanted to provide a how to guide for what you as a mobile game dev should think about when soft launching and global launching your next mobile game.
