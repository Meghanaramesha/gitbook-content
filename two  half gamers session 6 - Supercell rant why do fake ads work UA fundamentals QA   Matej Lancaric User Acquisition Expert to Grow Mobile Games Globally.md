##### **Google to limit ad tracking across apps on Android**

Google has announced new measures that will limit tracking across its Android operating system, following a similar move by Apple to introduce restraints in the way the online advertising industry can target users. The changes, which will not be implemented for at least two years, are intended to curb the sharing of user data with third parties, restricting advertising tracking for users who move between different apps on billions of devices running Android. Google said it planned to eventually phase out advertising IDs, a code that allows marketers to track individual user behaviour, in favour of alternatives that protected user data while still supporting advertising efforts.

**Supercell revenue increases 45% to $2.24bn in 2021**

Supercell published its financial results for 2021, with revenue reaching $2.24 billion (€1.89 billion) compared to $1.48 billion (€1.30 billion) in 2020 — a 45.3% increase year-on-year.

The studio generated profits before taxes of $852 million (€734 million), an impressive 80.3% growth compared to 2020’s $463 million (€407 million).

But it’s still not quite back to the [level of its 2015 heydays](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-03-09-supercells-2015-financials-impress), when the company made over $2 billion in revenue and $965 million (€848 million) in EBITDA.

The post also said that Clash of Clans and Clash Royale have now made over $10 billion in combined revenue since their respective launches.

**Spotify is acquiring two major podcast tech platforms**

Spotify is making more podcast acquisitions. The company [announced today](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-02-16/spotify-acquires-podsights-and-chartable-to-advance-podcast-measurement-for-advertisers-and-insights-for-publishers/) it’s acquiring both Chartable and Podsights — two of the most prominent podcast marketing and ad attribution companies. The deal price hasn’t been disclosed, but this marks the first major acquisition the company has made this year in a long line of audio purchases.

This deal is particularly critical for the company as it tries to make its ad platform the best and most powerful in audio. If it wants everyone to purchase ads through its marketplace, then it needs technology to better figure out who’s listening to those ads and what they’re doing after hearing them.
