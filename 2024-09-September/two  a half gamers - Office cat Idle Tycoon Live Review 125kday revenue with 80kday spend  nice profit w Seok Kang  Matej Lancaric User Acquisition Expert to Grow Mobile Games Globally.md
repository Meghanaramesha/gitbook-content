##### **Summary**

In this episode of Two and a Half Gamers, the hosts interview Seok and Hayne from Tripla, a South Korean company known for their cat-themed tycoon games. They discuss the success of their game Office Cat and its unique mechanics. The game does not have a reset mechanic, which reduces player frustration and dropout rates. The game also features a secondary loop with a factory and production puzzles, a rich index where players can increase their ‘rich cat’ status, and various management mechanics. The hosts also highlight the clever ad placements in the game, which contribute to its revenue. Office Cats primarily generates revenue from in-app purchases (IAP) rather than ads. The team experiments with different ways to promote the permanent ad removal option, offering it at a discount for a limited time. They have found that users who purchase the ad removal option are more likely to make additional purchases in the game. The team has a small UA team and produces a variety of creatives, including playables and videos, with no set schedule. The game has a retention rate of 35% on day 1 and 5% on day 30.
