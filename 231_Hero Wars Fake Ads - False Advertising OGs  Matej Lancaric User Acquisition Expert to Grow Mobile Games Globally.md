Hero Wars (Fake) Ads have become synonymous with the rise of deceptive marketing tactics in mobile games, positioning the title as a pioneer of false advertising strategies. The game, often associated with misleading creatives, revolutionized user acquisition (UA) by crafting ads that diverged significantly from actual gameplay. These tactics, heavily influenced by Playrix’s marketing innovations, have reshaped the industry’s approach to ad campaigns, prioritizing engagement over authenticity. Developers behind Hero Wars leveraged fake ads to drive revenues, effectively boosting their user base while sparking debates about ethical advertising in gaming. As a result, the timeline of mobile game marketing now prominently features Hero Wars as a case study in balancing creative ad strategies with the expectations of potential players. This controversial yet financially impactful approach highlights the evolving role of ad creatives in shaping user perception and revenue streams in the mobile gaming ecosystem.

## What are Fake Ads?

Fake ads are misleading or deceptive advertisements that present false information or exaggerated claims to persuade consumers.

You already know why is it happening. Running and growing a game is not an easy job. You need to involve a lot of departments in this! It’s not only on the marketing side of things. You need to work very closely with the game team, data analytics, and ideally live ops as well.

Scale/budget is always dictated by your game’s LTV as mentioned in these [UA tips](https://lancaric.me/11-tips-for-killer-user-acquisition-q3-version/). Marketing = UA + Creatives + ASO can help you by 10-20% here and there.

But you won’t be able to scale your game only with marketing tricks & hacks. That’s impossible. But is that really true? CPI vs LTV equation is really important. And if you are unable to drive the LTV up, then you need to do whatever it takes to lower the CPI down – below your LTV. **WHATEVER IT TAKES! Do you hear me?**

![cpi ltv ROAS](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-21.24.53-1024x619.png)

Lately, we have seen many games trying to implement the practices behind [fake ads](https://lancaric.me/fake-ads-in-user-acquisition-the-untold-story/) into actual products which is definitely new.

This again evolved itself as it first started as an attempt to **prolong the illusion that the game is the same as the fake ads**. This was done rather crudely through “duct taping” the **fake ads into the onboarding funnel** between the levels where fake ads playables were played by the user and then the real core gameplay of the game would be inserted in between.

After a while, the fake ads would disappear and the real game would take over as seen in the example below.

## How Nexters & Hero Wars are Fake Ads OG?

Nexters and hero wars are fake ads OG in following ways:

The Nexters story dates back to 2010 when the future **friends and founders** of Nexters first met. In those days, Andrey Fadeev was running Progrestar, a social games development studio, and Boris Gertsovskiy was shaping his plan to start a game business.

Later Boris Gertsovskiy became the President of the game studio Crazy Bit, and the two companies began their partnership, which resulted in the birth of Nexters in 2014. In the following years, the company grew quickly and released such games as Throne Rush, Chibi Island, and it’s blockbuster – **Hero Wars**.

While their games were quite successful on social, the real boom started in 2018 with the strategic decision to scale on mobile (and maybe the strategic Playrix involvement in their company structure – In the summer of 2018, the founders of Playrix, brothers Igor Bukhman and Dmitry Bukhman acquired a stake in Nexters). Since then, Nexters has vastly increased its players, bookings, and team, which today consists of over 600 game developers.

Nexters generated $318 million in bookings and $120 million in free cash flow to equity (FCFE) in 2020. As of 2020, 35% of the company’s net bookings came from the United States, 23% from Europe, and 19% from Asia. Its flagship product, Hero Wars RPG, was downloaded 36 million times in 2020 on iOS and Android.

#### 

In February 2021, Nexters announced it would go public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC deal with Kismet Acquisition One Corp. The merger valued Nexters at $1.9 billion. On August 27, 2021, Nexters went public on Nasdaq under the ticker GDEV.

In 2021, in addition to the released Chibi Island at the end of the year, the company soft-launched the new casual game Island Questaway. Nexters plans to launch a match-3-style game, Riddle Island in 2022.

[In January 2022, Nexters acquired](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/01/27/2374198/0/en/Nexters-enters-agreements-to-acquire-three-gaming-companies-investing-100-million-to-expand-in-midcore-genres.html) Cubic Games for $70M, 48.8% of MX Capital Limited (RJ Games) for $15M, and 49.5% of Castcrown Limited (Royal Ark) for $4.95M.

On February 28, 2022, Nasdaq, Inc., halted trading in the stock of Nexters, Inc. and four Russia-based companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The halts were due to regulatory concerns as the stock exchange seeks more information following economic sanctions imposed on Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine

They are geniuses, even though this is one **big pile of fake shit**. Let’s take a look at their current creatives:

https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1ffdebfecb865fe7bc4ce18dbddb2d83-1.mp4

All of these concepts match the Android store. They are all fake, but they are setting up some expectations and those expectations are met in the store.

## What are the User Acquisition Creatives & Experiments of Hero Wars?

## What is the Revenue of Hero Wars through Fake ads?

Okay okay okay, why are we even here? Ah yes! To understand how and when Hero Wars brought fake ads to life. Sorry, I got a little bit sidetracked.

May & August 2019 – Pull the pin was born! 

This is a very important date in the history of [fake ads](https://lancaric.me/fake-ads-in-user-acquisition-the-untold-story/). Hero Wars introduces a new feature image and things start to happen. They quickly understood what is working well and started a series of iterations. In August, they brought a new, slightly improved feature graphic.

## What was the Few Iterations in 2020?

Iterations/experiments were mostly done on the ASO side. Icon change and adding a fake screenshot into the first position to enhance the illusion.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-15-at-22.28.45.png)

Early 2021 – April!  

Change of a creative strategy is here. Could you guess what happened? Oh yeah! The famous “tower fighting concept” is here with an ASO change as well! This time, first two screenshots are showcasing the fake ads.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-15-at-22.32.31.png)

## What was the 2021 UA Creatives?

https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/250acb13219423398dd7ad5506a33aec.mp4

This is exactly the time when [Mighty Party realises](https://lancaric.me/fake-ads-in-user-acquisition-the-untold-story/) this tower concept is working quite well for Hero Wars and started the first creative tests. Which became a full-fledged Mighty party overhaul in July-August 2021.

## How did Hero Wars Implement Fake Ads?

Hero Wars Implemented Fake Ads in following ways:

Hero wars pushes the first playable of a fake ad right from the start of the game, therefore the transition from the store that is full of screenshots of this fake ad seems seamless. Players won’t notice any fake advertising immediately.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-25-at-20.42.53-1024x322.png)

Afterwards the game takes over and there is one level of gameplay on the sagamap and then another fake ad level is played. It needs to be noted here that the playable works surprisingly well, the user can still fail and if he doesn’t want to bother with it he can skip. The fake level is quite enjoyable actually, as there is the usual trial and error phase, where you want to see what happens and how the lava actually behaves in the physics puzzle.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-25-at-20.54.49-1024x232.png)

After level 3 the original game takes over and shows the player the main menu hub.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-25-at-21.01.10-1024x217.png)

The illusion is now complete as the player at this phase still expects that the fake ad puzzles would show up somewhere between the levels as they did before (spoiler they won’t) so he continues playing. **The legend says this player is still waiting for more puzzles in the game ..**

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-25-at-21.05.45-1024x275.png)

Hero Wars guys are Fake ads OGs, thats where the Mighty Party got the inspiration from.

## What is the Role of Playrix in Hero War?

The role of playrix in hero wars is as followed:

Suddenly their games saw exponential growth in revenues. A coincidence? Hell no! Wait a second! Could this be connected to their M&A activity when they acquired a stake in Nexters back in days?

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-15-at-22.48.04-1024x367.png)

Let’s look at all creatives!

## What was the Strategic Investment between Hero Wars and Playrix?

The Strategic Investment between Hero Wars and Playrix is as followed:

The outstanding growth of all of Playrix’s games was thanks to Hero wars fake ads breakthrough. Since Playrix invested in them (acquired a stake of the company) they had all the knowledge and insights from the trenches. I guess the ROI of that M&A actions is fucking huge!
