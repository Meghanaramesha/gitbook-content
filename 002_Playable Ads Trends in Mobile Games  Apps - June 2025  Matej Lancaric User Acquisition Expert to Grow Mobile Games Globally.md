As the UA landscape evolves, so do the creative trends that shape how games communicate with their audiences. With the rise of Applovin and increased spend on SDK networks, I’ve decided to bring you **a monthly trends review** of top-performing **playable ads** across different genres.

For those that read only summaries, here are playable trends June in a nutshell:

* Matching Madness or Anxiety Madness?
  + The world of match-3 playables seems to have hit peak anxiety. But there are some serious contenders with a fresh twist.
* Word Jam – Association Puzzle: Emojis Done Right.
  + When it comes to word association games, **Word Jam** is proving that sometimes adding a little visual difference can go a long way.
* Temu – The E-commerce Giant Showing the Way for Playables
  + While playables have long been dominated by gaming apps, **Temu** is proving that interactive ads can work wonders beyond gaming.
* Playable that made us play – My Baby Unicorn – Pony Care
  + I know it’s for young audience – but playable with pooping unicorn on the toilet? Yes please!
* Data from PlayableMaker – what’s being created?

## Matching Madness or Anxiety Madness?

The world of match-3 playables seems to have hit peak anxiety. Everywhere I look – whether it’s **Royal Kingdom**, **Fishdom**, **Match Villains**, or **Matchington Mansion**– it’s the same story: your favorite characters are in distress, and only your matching skills can save them. The pressure is relentless. These games are pushing a frantic narrative that leaves my own anxiety levels spiking just from watching the playables.

Let’s break it down:

### The Anxiety Formula

The premise is simple, and it works – at least in terms of engagement. The narrative usually goes something like this, as you all probably know:

* Someone is trapped, drowning or freezing.
* You’re the hero, but you can only save them by solving match-3 puzzles.
* And, of course, the timer is ticking.

Every single creative follows the same high-stakes “save them or fail” storyline. As much as it’s not innovative, it’s still very effective.

Why does this formula persist?

* **It’s Emotional**: These ads tap into primal emotions – fear, urgency, and guilt. Who wouldn’t want to save a drowning puppy?
* **It’s Addictive**: The high-pressure scenarios create a sense of mission. You *have* to download the game to see what happens next.
* **It Converts**: The formula has proven itself time and time again, so why reinvent the wheel?

But after seeing the same narrative recycled so many times, it’s starting to feel tired. Worse, it’s becoming overwhelming.

### A Refreshing Take: My Lovely Planet

Enter **My Lovely Planet**, which feels like a breath of fresh air amidst the chaos. You don’t save anyone but you actually plant real trees, like for real. Your progress is rewarded by physical tree being planted on our planet. Let’s see if in the creatives they will stick to their positive philosophy or go with the trend…

## Word Jam – Association Puzzle: Emojis Done Right

When it comes to word association games, **Word Jam** is proving that sometimes, adding a little visual flair can go a long way. Their use of emojis in playables elevates the gaming experience, making it not only more engaging but also more memorable. In a genre that often leans heavily on plain text and minimal visuals, this creative decision is a standout factor.

### Why Emojis Work for Word Jam

**Emotional Connection**: Emojis evoke emotions and make the game feel more personal. A smiley face or heart resonates far more than a single word ever could.

**Instant Recognition**: Emojis are universal. They convey meaning instantly and eliminate the need for lengthy explanations.

**Engagement Boost**: Matching emojis feels more interactive and fun, especially when compared to plain text. It adds a layer of visual appeal that keeps players hooked.

### Why This Stands Out in the Genre

Word association games are often text-heavy and can feel repetitive. By integrating emojis, **Word Jam** manages to:

* Create a fresh aesthetic that sets it apart from competitors.
* Break the monotony of plain text visuals.
* Appeal to a broader, younger audience that is accustomed to emoji-heavy communication.



## Temu – The E-commerce Giant Showing the Way for Playables

While some of the gaming companies still hesitate to use playables, **Temu** is proving that interactive ads can work wonders beyond gaming. Their approach? A mix of **simple puzzles**, **interactive end cards**, and **shopping simulations** that mimic browsing and adding items to a cart. It’s a masterstroke in engaging users and grabbing their attention. And as everything with Temu, all of them end with a big bonus, discount or “free” gift.

### The Playable Strategy: What Temu is Doing Right

1. **Simple Games**:  
   Temu incorporates easy-to-solve puzzles and simple games like penalty shoot as the first layer of engagement. These puzzles are low-pressure but intriguing enough to hook users.
   * **Why It Works**: Simple game action triggers an immediate sense of accomplishment, priming users for the next action.
2. **Interactive End Cards**:  
   Instead of generic CTAs, Temu’s end cards let users interact further – browse items, explore deals, or “unlock” offers by completing actions.
   * **Why It Works**: Interactive end cards give users a taste of the shopping experience, making the transition to the app feel seamless and rewarding. and of course – FOMO!
3. **Shopping Simulations**:  
   Some playables mimic the actual shopping experience, allowing users to browse items, add them to a cart, and even see discounts applied.
   * **Why It Works**: Giving users a hands-on preview of the app builds familiarity and lowers the barrier to entry. If it’s already in the cart, you are only one step away from buying right?

### Why This Approach Stands Out

In a space where most e-commerce ads rely on static visuals or video ads, Temu is blazing a trail with its playable strategy:

* **Engagement First**: The mix of simple games and interactivity ensures users are engaged and prepared for receiving the message.
* **Almost like buying**: By simulating the actual shopping experience, Temu takes the user to the feeling he is already shopping – and breaks the first barrier.
* **Cross-Industry Inspiration**: They’re borrowing proven mechanics from gaming playables and adapting them for e-commerce, creating a fresh perspective on how to engage users.
* **Think Beyond the CTA**: Temu’s playables show that CTAs can be more than just “Download Now.” Get a bonus, receive a discount, shop now or lose, you already fear that you miss out on it huh?

## Playable Ad That Made Me Install a Game This Month

Every month, I come across hundreds of playable ads while I play other games. But only from time to time the ad/playable is so good that it makes me install the game as a completely natural process. This month’s winner? My Baby Unicorn – Pony Care by TutoTOONS. I know it’s for young audience – but playable with pooping unicorn on the toilet? Yes please!

### What Made This Playable Stand Out?

1. **Unexpected Humor**: Playables often lean on drama, action, or puzzles. But a unicorn on a toilet? That’s a curveball. The humor and absurdity caught me completely off guard in the best way possible.
2. **Interaction That Feels Fun**: Fart a lot, make a mess, clean it up and make the unicorn happy. I am a child I know and they got me.
3. **Relatable for All Ages**: Sure, it’s targeted at kids, but the humor is universal. Who wouldn’t crack a smile at the sheer absurdity of a unicorn bathroom adventure?
4. **It’s Memorable**: In a sea of similar playables, this one stuck with me for its sheer uniqueness.

## Data from PlayableMaker – whats being created?
