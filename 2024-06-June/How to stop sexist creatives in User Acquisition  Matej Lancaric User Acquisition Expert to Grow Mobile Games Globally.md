The persistence of sexist creatives in user acquisition (UA) campaigns is a pressing issue in the advertising industry, reflecting deep-rooted biases and outdated narratives. These ads often rely on gender stereotypes, objectification, and misleading emotional triggers to provoke reactions, undermining ethical advertising standards. The role of ad networks in perpetuating these practices, driven by profit motives, highlights the need for industry-wide accountability. Meanwhile, brands and mobile game developers face growing pressure to create inclusive campaigns that resonate authentically with diverse audiences. This article delves into actionable strategies to combat sexism in UA, from reporting unethical ads and supporting organizations that advocate for change to implementing ethical creative practices. By fostering a culture of respect and inclusivity, the advertising landscape can shift toward campaigns that not only engage but also empower consumers.

What impact do sexist ads in mobile games have on players?
----------------------------------------------------------

The impact sexist ads in mobile games have on players includes fostering gender stereotypes, alienating diverse audiences, and creating a hostile gaming environment.Advertising as a whole has progressed tremendously. Yes, there are biases or misrepresentations in traditional media, but mobile ads take it to a whole new level.

These creatives straight-up depict women as sexual objects or portray them in subservient roles. This perpetuates the idea that women are inferior to men and are only valuable for their appearance or sexual appeal. This can have a damaging effect on how both men and women view and treat each other, and **can contribute to a culture of misogyny and gender inequality.**

This is undoubtedly harmful to players. Seeing these creatives can lead to feelings of body shaming, self-esteem issues, and even depression. For younger players especially, these ads can have a damaging effect on their self-image and self-worth. [A study by a Harvard instructor](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/exploring-the-effect-of-social-media-on-teen-girls-mental-health/) and researcher concluded that “the more teenage girls are on social media and exposed to image-based social media in particular, the more likely they are to have poor body image.”

These ads not only exist on social media platforms, but on popular websites, too. More broadly, sexist ads in mobile games contribute to a larger culture of objectification and sexualization of women. I’m not here to say sexist ads are the root cause of this, but it certainly plays a role.

How do sexist ads impact mobile game user acquisition?
------------------------------------------------------

Sexist ads impact mobile game user acquisition by alienating potential players, especially women and diverse audiences, leading to reduced appeal and lower conversion rates. Published by the Danish developer, Tactile Games, Lily’s Garden is a match-3 blast game. What seems like an innocent gardening puzzle game, a lot of the sexist ad trends can be traced back to it.

The goal of the game is to help Lily renovate her great-aunt’s garden. And along the way, Lily interacts with a cast of intriguing characters, which forms the game’s narrative meta layer. We all remember all those bizarre and shocking creatives about pregnancy, NSFW, penis-sizing innuendo, cheating, etc. The goal is to shock viewers, grab their attention with something unexpected, and make Lily’s universe much more exciting.

The most disturbing fact is that these are not designed for adults – and are so blatantly targeting children.

That’s not all. Some of the recent creatives IMHO crossed the line a bit.

But it doesn’t stop there. It’s not just skimpy clothing for dress-up games. It’s much deeper and more real than that:

* Men cheating on their partners
* Glorifying rich men / bosses / CEOs
* Women needing massive makeovers to keep their boyfriends and husbands happy
* Men getting angry (and punching their pregnant wives?? I’m not going to bother linking to this one)
* Abandoning children
* Mobile games about running a harem…

How do sexist creatives affect user acquisition in mobile games?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Sexist creatives affect user acquisition in mobile games by deterring diverse audiences, reducing ad effectiveness, and damaging the brand’s reputation.

CPI’s are super high in the Match3 genre, you can’t really grow the LTV. **The CPI vs LTV equation** doesn’t work.

I talked about this in the [Fake ads](https://lancaric.me/fake-ads-in-user-acquisition-the-untold-story/) article. If you really think about it, it’s the same strategy all over again. When something is clearly working, others want to copy it. But in this case, instead of misleading creatives, you use narrative and story-driven creatives (isn’t it fake too?) to get the **attention, create drama, plot twists, misogyny, and a bit of sexism** here and there.

So far, we could see examples of smaller games trying to achieve growth at all costs. Big guys are also using the concept of picturing a homeless family “begging” for gold or a family trying not to freeze. **WTF is wrong with you, people?**

Unfortunately, the Match3 genre is not the only one where we see this type of creatives. 

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Here are some examples:

Tile Family
-----------

Gossip Harbor
-------------

Garden Affairs
--------------

Seriously, this is even worse.

Don’t even know who is this, but seriously?
-------------------------------------------

How do fake ads boost mobile game downloads and user acquisition?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fake ads boost mobile game downloads and user acquisition by using exaggerated or misleading content to capture attention and spark curiosity. If it works, it’ll continue to grow. I mention [why fake ads are performing so well in another article](https://lancaric.me/hero-wars-fake-ads-false-advertising/). Essentially, huge game developers like Nexer’s Global, who were responsible for the infamous Hero Wars ads, were valued at $1.9 Billion  when they went public on Nasdaq after driving over 36 million downloads to that ONE game. 

How can we stop sexist ads in mobile games?
-------------------------------------------

We can stop sexist ads in mobile games by promoting diversity in creative teams, conducting inclusive audience research, and implementing strict content review processes. Sexist ads are a pervasive problem that can be found in mobile games. It’s really hard to stop this behavior, but there are steps we can take together!

### **The first line of defense: report every ad you see**

If you Google “how to report mobile game ads,” you’ll find a lot of frustrated users wondering why it’s so difficult. Hint: it’s by design. Reporting can be difficult, because advertising platforms want to pocket more cash!

If you come across a sexist ad in a mobile game or any other medium, report it to the game developer or advertiser. Here’s how:

1. Some – not all – ads have a V, F, or I symbol at the corner of the screen to report the ad. This is reported directly to the ad network. Sometimes you’ll unfortunately have to watch the whole ad before this shows.
2. You can also take a screenshot of the ad and email the developer. If they are responsible, they will crack down on bad advertising to not only save face, but help maintain a good user experience
3. Leave a negative review on the game itself, mentioning its unethical ads

Here are some important links:

* [Report Google Play](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7660847?hl=en)
* [Report on Apple (they don’t have a direct option to report ads)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/106932)
* [Report on Facebook](https://m.facebook.com/help/162606073801742)
* [Report TikTok ad](https://www.tiktok.com/privacy/ads-and-your-data/en)

### **Put pressure on developers and ad networks**

The second line of defense is making a ruckus. Write emails to developers and networks. Create new forum threads about reporting features. Write on social media and Reddit about how hard it is to report ads. More noise = more pressure.

### **Support mobile games that do not use sexist ads**

In addition, supporting mobile games that do not use sexist advertising can help to encourage game developers and advertisers to avoid using these types of ads. Look for games that have a positive and inclusive approach to advertising and consider supporting them through downloads or in-app purchases. By supporting these games, you can send a message to the industry that there is a demand for more respectful and empowering advertising.

### **Support organizations that work to combat sexist ads**

Another way to stop sexist ads is by supporting organizations that work to combat them. There are several organizations, such as the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the US, that work to ensure that advertising is respectful and not harmful to society. Consider supporting these organizations through donations or by advocating for their work.

Here are a few organizations to consider:

* [She Runs It](https://sherunsit.org/)
* [Women’s Media Group](https://www.womensmediagroup.org/)
* [Alliance for Women in Media](https://allwomeninmedia.org/)
* [Institute for Advertising Ethics](https://www.iaethics.org/)

What are Facebook’s advertising policies for ethical ads?

What does Google’s ad policy say about sexual content in user acquisition?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Google’s ad policy prohibits sexually explicit content, suggestive themes, and inappropriate imagery in user acquisition campaigns.

### [Sexual content](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6023699)

Ads should respect user preferences and comply with legal regulations, so they don’t allow certain kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations.  Some kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations are allowed only if they comply with the policies below and don’t target minors, but they will only show in limited scenarios based on user search queries, user age, and local laws where the ad is being served.

*Examples of restricted sexual content:* Visible genitalia and female breasts, hook-up dating, sex toys, strip clubs, sexually suggestive live chat, and models in sexualized poses.

How can mobile game ads promote inclusivity and respect for all genders?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile game ads can promote inclusivity and respect for all genders by using diverse representations of characters, avoiding stereotypes, and showcasing equal opportunities for all players. It is important for mobile game developers and advertisers to be aware of the impact of their advertising and to refrain from using sexist or objectifying ads. Instead, they should strive to produce respectful and empowering creatives**to all genders**. By doing so, they can help create a more positive and inclusive environment for players and society as a whole.

It’s possible. Just look at the latest Match Factory or Match Masters creatives!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can mobile game ads avoid sexism and promote inclusivity?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile game ads can avoid sexism and promote inclusivity by representing all genders equally, avoiding stereotypical portrayals, and using diverse characters in empowering roles.

In conclusion, **sexist ads in mobile games** are wrong because they reinforce harmful gender stereotypes, can be harmful to players, and contribute to a larger culture of objectification and sexualization of women. It is important for mobile game developers and advertisers to be mindful of the impact of their advertising and to create ads that are respectful and empowering to all genders.

How can educating others help prevent sexist ads in user acquisition?

Educating others helps prevent sexist ads in user acquisition by raising awareness about the negative impact of stereotypes and promoting more inclusive advertising practices.
