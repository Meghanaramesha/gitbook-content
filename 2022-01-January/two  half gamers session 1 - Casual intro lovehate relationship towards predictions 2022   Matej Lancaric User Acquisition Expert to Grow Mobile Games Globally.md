Welcome to our first episode of two & half gamers! In first episode we covered various topics:

* Basic intro of our new podcast and the crew
* Predictions for gaming industry for this year
* Our view and brutally subjective (“WINK WINK”) feelings about those predictions

Panelists: [Jakub Remia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakubremiar/)r, [Felix Braberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/), [Matej Lančarič](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matejlancaric/)

**Predictions?**

* Who will be the biggest winner in the mobile gaming ecosystem in 2022?
* Who will be the biggest loser in the mobile gaming ecosystem in 2022?
* What was the biggest surprise you saw in the mobile gaming ecosystem in 2021?

**No play-to-earn games in mobile app stores**

How do we see it? Play to Earn vs Play and Earn Ponzi schemes + Scholarship mechanic – Prevalence in low salary countries Big Friction in user funnel Wallet & exchanges fees Very steep initial investment in some games (Axxie) User acquisition Discord communities & Early investors Conventional user acquisition Games soft launched/global launched in summer (and onwards) will have some form of blockchain in it What is it going to be like?
