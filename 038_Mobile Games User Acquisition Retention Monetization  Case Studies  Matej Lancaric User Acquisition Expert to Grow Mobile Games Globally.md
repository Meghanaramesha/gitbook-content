The monetization strategies help developers generate revenue while offering a balanced user experience.

This guide explores the essential strategies for user acquisition, retention and monetization in mobile games, complemented by insightful case studies that illustrate successful implementations in the competitive gaming landscape.

## **What are Mobile Games?**

Mobile games are video games designed to be played on smartphones or tablets. They range from simple casual games to complex immersive gaming experiences. Mobile games offer touch controls, connectivity features and various monetization models like in-app purchases or ads.

## **How to Develop a Mobile Game?**

To develop a mobile game, design a strong game idea, create a design document, focus on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI), choose a game engine, develop game mechanics, and design graphics, test for bugs and optimize app performance.

## **What is Soft Launch?**

A soft launch is the release of a mobile game to a limited audience or region. The purpose is to test performance, gather user feedback, and identify issues before a full-scale launch to a wider market.

A soft launch is important for mobile games because the launch allows developers to test key aspects like user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and overall gameplay with a smaller, controlled audience. The soft launch process helps identify bugs, optimize performance, and gather valuable user feedback that helps in adjustments before the full release. Soft launch also helps in understanding the game’s appeal, retention rates, and monetization strategies for a smoother and more successful global launch with fewer risks. By addressing potential issues early on, the soft launch increases the chances of the game’s long-term success in the competitive mobile gaming market.

## **What is Global Launch?**

A global launch is the full release of a mobile game across all intended markets after successful testing in specific regions. Global launch follows a soft launch by targeting a wider audience for maximum reach, revenue generation, and user acquisition.

A global launch is important for mobile games as the launch on a global level allows developers to reach a wider audience and maximize their potential revenue. Global launch helps solidify the game’s presence in competitive markets and leads to long-term success. By launching globally, developers gain valuable user feedback on a large scale, identify performance issues across different devices and regions, and refine monetization strategies to optimize revenue streams. The global launch also sets the stage for marketing and user acquisition efforts to boost the game’s visibility and player base worldwide.

## **What is Mobile Game User Acquisition?**

Mobile game user acquisition refers to the strategies and methods used to attract and convert new players to download and engage with a mobile game through advertising, partnerships, social media and app store optimization (ASO). [Mobile game user acquisition](https://lancaric.me/mobile-games-marketing-growth/) works by attracting new players through targeted marketing strategies designed to increase downloads and engagement. Developers use channels like social media, in-app advertising, influencer marketing, app store optimization, incentivized installs, and paid ads to reach potential players. Once a campaign is launched, metrics like Cost Per Install (CPI), Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Conversion Rate are tracked to measure the effectiveness of the efforts. By analyzing user behavior and optimizing campaigns, developers fine-tune their approach to acquire users who are more likely to engage, retain, and eventually spend money within the game.

### What is User Acquisition Cost for Mobile Games?

User Acquisition Cost (UAC) for mobile games is the average amount of money spent on marketing and advertising to acquire a single new player or user for a mobile game. User Acquisition Cost (UAC) is important for mobile games because UAC helps developers understand how much they are spending to gain each new player. By tracking [user acquisition cost](https://lancaric.me/cost-ua-moile-games/), developers measure the efficiency of their marketing efforts and make sure they are getting a good return on investment (ROI). A lower UAC means acquiring users at a lower cost that is essential for profitability, especially in competitive markets. UAC also helps in optimizing marketing budgets by focusing on channels and strategies that attract high-value users who are likely to stay engaged and make in-app purchases.

### What are the Best User Acquisition Strategies?

SEO helps drive organic traffic, reduce reliance on paid ads, and lower acquisition costs. A well-optimized game page improves credibility and attracts high-intent users who are more likely to download and engage with the game.
* **App Store Optimization (ASO):**  
  App Store Optimization (ASO) is the process of enhancing a mobile app’s visibility and ranking in app stores such as the Apple App Store and Google Play by optimizing the app’s title, keywords, description, visuals, and user engagement metrics. [App Store Optimization (ASO)](https://lancaric.me/aso-tips-ua-mobile-games/) works as a user acquisition strategy by enhancing a mobile game’s visibility within app stores like Google Play and Apple’s App Store. ASO  involves optimizing elements such as the game’s title, description, keywords, screenshots, and app icon to improve the app’s ranking in search results and appeal to potential users. The goal is to attract more organic downloads by making the game easier to find for users searching for related terms. Effective ASO boosts visibility and increases conversion rates because users are more likely to download an app that looks appealing and relevant.

The influencers create content such as gameplay videos, reviews, or live streams showcasing the game to their followers. Since influencers have a trusted relationship with their audience, their endorsement drives interest and encourages downloads among their fanbase. The influencer marketing strategy helps reach niche or large audiences, builds credibility for the game, and results in highly engaged users who trust the influencer’s recommendations.
* **Paid User Acquisition (UA) Campaigns:**   
  Paid User Acquisition (UA) campaigns are marketing efforts where businesses invest in paid channels such as social media ads, search ads, and display networks, to attract new users to their apps, websites, or products.

The UA  campaigns involve running ads on platforms like Google, Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok, where ads are customized to specific user segments based on demographics, behaviors, or interests. By investing in paid UA campaigns, game developers attract a steady flow of new players quickly and effectively. The ads are optimized for app installs or user actions to confirm that the game reaches users who are likely to engage and convert. Paid UA campaigns are essential for scaling user growth and expanding the game’s player base efficiently.
* **Referral Programs:**   
  Referral programs incentivize existing users or customers to invite others to use a product or service by offering rewards such as discounts or credits, to both the referrer and the referred.

Participants receive rewards such as in-game currency, exclusive items, or bonuses for each successful referral they make. The referral strategy uses the social networks of current players to expand the game’s reach organically because users are more likely to trust recommendations from friends or family. Referral programs drive new installs and promote player retention because users who are referred by friends have a higher level of engagement and longer-term interest in the game.
* **Content Marketing:**   
  Content marketing is a strategy focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and engage a target audience. Content marketing works as a user acquisition strategy by creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and engaging content to attract and retain potential players for a mobile game.

By providing informative or entertaining content, developers build brand awareness, establish authority, and drive traffic to the game’s download page. Content marketing helps capture the interest of potential users, encourages organic sharing, and nurtures a community around the game.
* **Pre-Launch Marketing:**   
  Pre-launch marketing involves promoting a product or service before the official release to build anticipation, generate buzz, and attract potential customers or users through strategies such as teasers, early access, and targeted campaigns.

The pre-launching strategy involves creating teaser campaigns, engaging potential players through social media, running beta tests, and sharing sneak peeks or exclusive content to create excitement and capture interest. By using tactics such as influencer partnerships, early access promotions, and email sign-ups, developers build a pre-launch user base. Effective pre-launch marketing helps establish a community of eager players and results in a successful launch and sustained momentum as the game goes live.
* **In-App Events and Promotions:**   
  In-app events and promotions are marketing activities within a mobile app that offer special deals, limited-time offers, or engaging experiences to encourage user participation, retention, and increased in-app spending. In-App Events and Promotions work as a user acquisition strategy by offering special events, limited-time offers, or exclusive in-game content to attract and retain players. The events include seasonal challenges, themed activities, or promotional sales that encourage both new and existing users to engage with the game more frequently. By creating a sense of urgency and excitement, developers drive increased downloads and player activity, and incentivize current users to invite friends or participate more actively. The in-app promotion strategy boosts user acquisition and enhances player retention by keeping the game dynamic and engaging.
* **Retargeting Campaigns:**   
  Retargeting campaigns are advertising strategies that target users who have previously interacted with a brand or website to re-engage them and drive conversions by reminding them of products or services they showed interest in. Retargeting campaigns work as a user acquisition strategy by targeting users who have previously interacted with the mobile game or the ads but have not yet completed a desired action such as making a purchase or installing the game. The retargeting campaigns use data on user behavior to deliver personalized ads that remind and inspire the potential players to return and take action. By focusing on users who have already shown interest, retargeting campaigns improve conversion rates and cost-effectively re-engage potential players.
* **Localized Marketing:**   
  Localized marketing customizes advertising and promotional efforts to specific geographic regions or cultural groups to better resonate with local audiences and address their unique preferences and needs. Localized marketing works as a user acquisition strategy by customizing promotional efforts to specific geographic regions, languages, and cultural contexts to better resonate with local audiences. The localized marketing involves adapting the game’s content, advertisements, and messaging to align with regional preferences and trends that significantly improve engagement and download rates. By addressing the unique needs and interests of different markets, localized marketing enhances relevance and leads to more effective user acquisition. Localized marketing helps overcome cultural barriers, increases the game’s visibility in diverse regions, and builds a stronger connection with players.

### What are the Best Strategies for User Retention and Engagement?

The best strategies for [user retention and engagement](https://lancaric.me/user-retention-mobile-games/) include promoting brand loyalty, collecting customer feedback, improving the onboarding process, using gamification, building a community, creating personalized user experiences, exceeding customer expectations, improving customer support, and doing monetization without causing frustration.

Here’s a quick overview of the best strategies for user retention and engagement:

* **Brand loyalty**  
  Brand loyalty is the consistent preference and commitment of consumers to repeatedly purchase or engage with a specific brand over the brand’s competitors due to positive experiences, trust, and emotional connection with the brand.Brand loyalty plays an important role in user retention and engagement by building a strong emotional connection between players and the mobile game. When users trust and enjoy a game, they are more likely to keep playing, engage with in-game content, and recommend the game to others. The brand loyalty is built through positive user experiences, consistent updates, and rewarding gameplay that meets or exceeds player expectations. As users become more invested in the game and the brand, they stay longer and engage more deeply. Users then also participate in community events, make in-app purchases, or explore new game features. Ultimately, brand loyalty strengthens retention, boosts engagement, and contributes to long-term success.
* **Collect customer feedback**   
  Customer feedback is the information and opinions provided by consumers about their experiences with a product or service that helps businesses improve offerings, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive innovation. Collecting customer feedback is essential for user retention and engagement as customer feedback allows game developers to understand players’ needs, preferences, and pain points. By actively listening to user input, game developers make targeted improvements, fix issues, and introduce new features that align with player expectations to make the game enjoyable and relevant. Engaging with feedback also shows players that their opinions are valued and builds a sense of community and loyalty. The continuous feedback loop helps retain existing users by keeping the game fresh and responsive and encourages deeper engagement as players feel more connected and invested in the game’s success.
* **Improve the onboarding process**   
  Improving the onboarding process involves optimizing the steps and user experience for new customers or users to quickly understand, engage with, and successfully use a product or service. Improving the onboarding process is critical for user retention and engagement because the onboarding process sets the tone for a player’s entire experience with a mobile game. A smooth, intuitive onboarding helps new players quickly understand the game’s mechanics, features, and goals, reducing frustration and confusion. When players are introduced to the game effectively, they are more likely to feel confident and excited to continue playing. A well-designed onboarding highlights key aspects of the game that keep players engaged such as rewards or progression systems. Ultimately, improving onboarding boosts retention by making sure that new users don’t drop off early and are encouraged to explore and enjoy the game fully.
* **Use gamification**   
  Gamification is the integration of game-like elements such as points, badges, challenges, and rewards into non-game contexts to engage users and enhance their experience. Using gamification for user retention and engagement uses game-like elements such as points, badges, levels, and challenges to keep users motivated and invested. By incorporating the game-like elements, mobile games create a sense of achievement and progression that encourages players to keep playing. Gamification also taps into users’ competitive spirit by offering rewards for completing tasks or reaching milestones and fostering a deeper emotional connection to the game. Using gamification keeps the gameplay dynamic and fun and makes players feel accomplished while enticing them to return regularly.
* **Build a community**   
  Building a community involves creating and nurturing a group of people with shared interests or goals, promoting interaction, support, and engagement through platforms, events, or content. Building a community for user retention and engagement involves creating a space where players interact, share experiences, and form connections around a game. When users feel part of a community, they are more likely to remain loyal to the game beecause community fosters a sense of belonging and shared purpose. Features like chat rooms, forums, or social media groups allow users to discuss strategies, celebrate achievements, or collaborate on in-game events. The social interaction enhances the overall gaming experience, encouraging players to stay active, return frequently, and engage more deeply with the game and each other.
* **Create personalized customer experiences**   
  Personalized customer experiences customize interactions, content, and recommendations to individual preferences, behaviors, and needs by creating a more relevant and engaging journey for each customer. Creating personalized customer experiences for user retention and engagement involves customizing the gaming experience to individual preferences, habits, and behaviors. By offering customized content, rewards, and gameplay based on a player’s in-game actions or preferences, users feel more connected and valued. Personalized notifications, targeted promotions, and individualized recommendations enhance engagement by making the experience feel unique to each player. The personal touch increases satisfaction and loyalty because users are more likely to return and invest time in a game that adapts to their specific needs.
* **Exceed customer expectations**   
  Customer expectations are the preconceived beliefs or standards that consumers have regarding the quality, service, and overall experience they should receive from a brand or product. Exceeding customer expectations for user retention and engagement means delivering more value and a better experience than users anticipate. Exceeding user expectations involve surprising players with bonus content, unexpected rewards, or exceptional customer support that goes beyond the norm. By consistently offering features, updates, or services that surpass what players expect, you create a sense of delight and loyalty. When users feel like they’re receiving more than they paid for or that their needs are truly understood they’re more likely to stay engaged with the game and continue playing.
* **Improve your customer support**   
  Customer support is the assistance and guidance provided by a company to help customers resolve issues, answer questions, and provide a positive experience with the products or services. Improving your customer support directly enhances user retention and engagement by making the players feel valued and heard. Quick and effective resolutions to issues, whether through in-game support or external channels, create a positive experience even when problems arise. Offering personalized assistance, addressing concerns promptly, and maintaining open communication builds trust and loyalty. When users know they rely on support when needed they’re more likely to stay engaged with your game and build a strong relationship that keeps them coming back and encourages long-term retention.
* **Monetization Without Frustration**   
  Monetization without frustration refers to implementing revenue-generating strategies such as ads or in-app purchases in a way that enhances user experience rather than disrupting or frustrating that experience. Monetization without frustration works for user retention and engagement by offering players a way to enjoy the game without feeling forced to spend money or deal with disruptive ads. Striking a balance between monetization and gameplay such as using non-intrusive ads, fair in-app purchases, or well-timed offers confirms that players don’t feel pressured or frustrated. The approach keeps the gaming experience enjoyable while allowing for revenue generation. When users feel respected and not overwhelmed by monetization tactics, they are more likely to stay engaged and remain loyal to the game.

## **What are the Best Monetization Strategies for Mobile Games?**

The best [monetization strategies](https://lancaric.me/monetization-mobile-game) for mobile games include in-app purchases, advertising, data monetization, rewarded ads, freemium models, paid games, interstitial ads, in-app ads, and subscription models. The monetization strategies help game developers generate revenue while offering a balanced user experience.

Let’s dive into the details of the best monetization strategies for mobile games:

* **In-App Purchases**   
  In-app purchases allow users to buy additional content, features, or virtual items within a mobile app or game to enhance their experience or progress faster. In-app purchases are a key way mobile games make money by offering players extra content, features, or virtual items for a fee. The in-app purchases include things like new characters, power-ups, cosmetic upgrades, or even extra lives that enhance the gaming experience. Developers generate revenue from users who want to customize their experience or advance faster by allowing players to buy the extras directly in the game. The in-app purchases model works well because the model keeps the game free to play for everyone while offering optional purchases for those willing to spend and creates a steady income stream without requiring upfront payments.

* **Advertising**   
  Advertising involves displaying ads to users, generating revenue for developers through impressions, clicks, or completed views, and offering in-game rewards as incentives. Advertising helps mobile games make money by displaying ads to players during gameplay or between levels. Developers partner with ad networks to show different types of ads such as banner ads, video ads, or rewarded ads that give players in-game perks for watching. Every time a player views or interacts with an ad, the developer earns revenue. The advertising approach works especially well in free-to-play games and allows developers to keep the game accessible to everyone while still generating income from ads. Advertising is a win-win situation because players enjoy the game for free and developers earn from ad impressions or clicks.

* **Data Monetization**   
  Data monetization involves leveraging user data collected from app interactions to generate revenue through targeted advertising, insights for business decisions, or selling aggregated data to third parties. Data monetization helps mobile games generate revenue by collecting and analyzing user data such as gameplay behavior, preferences, and in-game purchases. Developers use the user data to improve the game experience, target ads more effectively, or sell anonymized data to third parties like marketers or advertisers. By understanding player habits, developers create more personalized experiences, introduce targeted in-app purchases, or partner with advertisers for tailored ads, all of which increase revenue. Data monetization turns insights into profits while helping to optimize the gaming experience and keep the game profitable.

* **Rewarded Ads**   
  Rewarded ads are a type of advertising where users voluntarily watch an ad or complete an action in exchange for in-game rewards such as currency, items, or bonuses. Rewarded ads help monetize mobile games by offering players incentives like extra lives, in-game currency, or special items in exchange for watching an ad. Players willingly engage with the rewarded ads because they receive rewards that improve their gameplay experience. For developers, rewarded ads creates a win-win situation where players get free perks while developers earn revenue from ad views or interactions. Since players opt-in to watch the ads, engagement rates are typically higher which makes them a valuable and non-intrusive monetization strategy.

* **Freemium**   
  Freemium is a business model where the basic version of a product or service is offered for free, but users pay for premium features, upgrades, or additional content. Freemium helps monetize mobile games by offering the core game for free while charging for premium features, content, or upgrades. Players enjoy the basic version of the game without paying, but if they want to enhance their experience, like unlocking new levels, customizing characters, or speeding up progress, they make in-app purchases. The freemium model attracts a large user base since the game is free to download and then a portion of players choose to spend money on additional features. Freemium is a balanced way to generate revenue and offer value to free users while monetizing through those willing to pay for extras.

* **Paid Games**   
  Paid games require users to purchase the game upfront and provide a complete experience without additional in-app purchases or advertisements. Paid games help monetize mobile games by charging players an upfront fee to download and access the full game. Unlike freemium or free-to-play models, there are no in-game purchases or ads needed to generate revenue since the initial purchase price covers the game’s cost. The paid approach allows developers to earn directly from each download and provides a steady income stream from players who prefer a one-time payment for a complete, ad-free experience. Paid games deliver high-quality content that justifies the price and appeal to players willing to invest for a premium experience.

* **Interstitial Ads**  
  Interstitial ads are full-screen advertisements that appear at natural transition points in an app or game, usually between levels or during pauses to capture the user’s full attention. Interstitial ads help monetize mobile games by displaying full-screen ads at natural pauses in the game such as between levels or during transitions. The interstitial ads capture the player’s full attention and require the user to interact with or close the ad before continuing. Because interstitial ads are more prominent and engaging than banner ads, they result in higher revenue per view or click for developers. They may interrupt gameplay briefly, but their careful placement minimizes disruption and helps developers to earn significant ad revenue while keeping the gaming experience relatively smooth for players.

* **In-App Ads**   
  In-app ads are advertisements displayed within a mobile application or game and are designed to generate revenue for developers while users interact with the app. In-app ads help monetize mobile games by integrating advertisements directly into the gameplay experience. In-app ads come in various formats such as banner ads, interstitial ads, video ads, or native ads, and are displayed at strategic points during or between game sessions. By incorporating in-app ads, developers earn revenue from advertisers every time a player views or interacts with an ad. The in-app ads model is effective for free-to-play games because the model allows developers to generate income without charging players upfront. In-app ads also provide players with a way to enjoy the game at no cost while developers benefit from ad impressions and clicks.

* **Subscription Model**   
  The subscription model charges users a recurring fee monthly or annually to access a product or service and provides ongoing updates, premium features, or ad-free experiences. The subscription model helps monetize mobile games by offering players access to exclusive content, features, or an enhanced gaming experience for a recurring fee on a weekly, monthly, or annual basis. Subscribers receive benefits such as ad-free gameplay, early access to new content, special in-game items, or other premium features that are not available to non-subscribers. The subscription model creates a steady revenue stream for developers because subscribers provide consistent income while enjoying ongoing updates and perks.

## **Are there any case Studies of Mobile Games User Acquisition?**

Following are some of the case studies about mobile game user acquisition covering different aspects under Soft Launch and Global Launch.

### Unity Ads: Playable End Cards Case Study

In 2021, Unity Ads emerged as the top performer in user acquisition particularly in Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) campaigns. Playable end cards, which is an interactive ad format that engages users after video ads proved instrumental in boosting engagement and reducing in-app purchase costs. Testing conducted over two months in the U.S. market showed a 50% higher Day 7 ROAS for Playable end cards despite a higher cost per install (CPI). Unity Ads successfully delivered increased ad engagement, reduced costs per purchase by 15%, and cut costs per payer by 9%, showcasing the effectiveness in mobile game advertising.

### Survivor.io: TikTok & UA Strategy Case Study

Survivor.io, developed by Habby has gained massive success through a well-executed user acquisition (UA) strategy. Combining minimalistic graphics and intense gameplay with hordes of zombies the game used TikTok as the primary UA channel and dedicated 50% of the budget there. The viral spread of creative gameplay videos on TikTok along with high-performing playable ads has allowed for reduced cost per install (CPI) and boosted Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). The game’s success in top markets like the U.S., Korea, Japan, and Brazil highlights the strong UA execution that is further supported by secondary channels like IronSource, Google, and Unity Ads.

### Marvel Snap: UA & Monetization Case Study

Marvel Snap partnered with Marvel Entertainment and Nuverse and was released with high expectations. With a simple six-turn and three-location gameplay the game is designed to attract both casual and strategic players. However, while the game has solid foundations and has seen success in user acquisition (UA) especially via Facebook and TikTok the UA strategy shows inefficiencies in ad targeting that include a lack of custom placements and audience exclusions. Despite being popular the monetization strategy is limited, focusing mainly on in-app purchases without ad revenue and leaving substantial growth potential untapped. With a generous season pass and friendly monetization Marvel Snap faces high cost-per-installs (CPIs) and challenges in scaling effectively. The creative team has room for improvement particularly in optimizing character usage and enhancing emotional engagement in ads.

### Century Games: Post-IDFA Scaling Case Study

Century Games is a global gaming company with over 1,000 employees across eight countries and has impressively scaled from $1 million per month in 2020 to $20 million per month by defying the challenges of the post-IDFA era. With a diverse portfolio that included casual to mid-core genres, the company successfully launched titles like Frozen City and Whiteout Survival. Frozen City stands out as an idle survival simulation inspired by Frostpunk combining resource management, hero upgrades, and town-building mechanics. Their UA strategy efficiently leverages multiple channels like Applovin, Facebook, and Google employing low-poly visual designs to reduce CPIs. With strong in-app purchases and ad revenue strategies Frozen City earns around $200k daily. The game’s innovation lies in the 3D graphics.

### Socialpoint’s Top Troops: UA Amid CPI Case Study

Socialpoint is a leading mobile game developer and globally launched Top Troops: Adventure RPG in October 2023 after a long soft launch. The game incorporates battle strategy with merge mechanics that increase unit strength through merging. Despite strong parallels to successful games like Battle Legion and the high CPIs common in merge games (over $40 in the US) Top Troops managed a successful launch by generating around $1 million in revenue within two weeks. Socialpoint leveraged a diversified user acquisition (UA) strategy across multiple platforms that included Google (the largest channel), Facebook, and TikTok’s Spark Ads. They also embraced influencer marketing to expand visibility. The game’s creatives are inspired by Top War and Hero Wars that focus on user-generated content and merge mechanics though the battle mechanics might offer better results. Playable ads and constant updates to creative assets ensure a healthy campaign. Socialpoint’s approach highlights the importance of both UA diversification and creative innovation in scaling a game globally.

### Supercell’s Squad Busters: Beta & Future Case Study

Squad Busters is Supercell’s latest entry into the mobile gaming market currently in beta testing and features characters from their most successful franchises like Clash of Clans, Brawl Stars, and Boom Beach. The game centers around a 10-player free-for-all mode called Gem Hunt where players assemble squads from various characters to compete and gather resources. While the game introduces innovative mechanics like merging characters and random gameplay modifiers Squad Busters faced criticism for repetitiveness and lack of skill-based depth. The progression system mirrors Brawl Stars combining a fixed reward track and a segmented battle pass. Despite interesting updates between beta versions such as reroll mechanics and character-based strategy Squad Busters is seen as light on monetization and social features. The game’s future success may depend on the introduction of team-based modes and increased depth because the current mode leans heavily on luck rather than skill. Players expect significant improvements before the game’s full release.

### Diggy’s Adventure: Soft Launch Success Case Study

Pixel Federation’s Diggy’s Adventure achieved success after the global mobile launch bringing in over €5 million in less than three months and tripling daily active users and revenues. The game’s successful launch on iOS and Android in 2016 followed a six-month soft launch period that tested user experience, marketing channels, and key metrics like CPI and LTV. Pixel Federation initially lacked market research but they adapted by analyzing competitors and leveraging Facebook ads to effectively reach target audiences through video-driven campaigns. The case highlights the importance of soft launches, creative asset testing, and the continuous refinement of user acquisition strategies. By diversifying paid user acquisition channels, testing creatives rigorously and understanding app store optimization Diggy’s Adventure stood out in a saturated market and eventually got featured by both Apple and Google.

### Supercell’s Mo.Co: Innovation & Feedback Case Study

Supercell’s upcoming game Mo.Co that is currently in closed beta has followed the company’s proven strategy of refining successful gaming formulas for mobile platforms as seen with HayDay and Clash of Clans. Mo.Co is an isometric action RPG with twin-stick controls that focus on monster grinding and social gameplay. The game stands out for the seamless party-based exploration and stunning visuals despite the simplified itemization system. With the strong social features, minimalist RPG mechanics, and high production values the game is drawing comparisons to Clash Heroes and Path of Exile. Supercell continues to employ the “kill or launch” philosophy in soft launches as the game undergoes testing without extensive user acquisition and relying on influencers for buzz. Despite some frustrations from players regarding raid matchmaking the game’s visual appeal and fluid mechanics have built anticipation for a potential global release.

### Supercell’s Floodrush vs Squad Busters Case Study

Floodrush, Supercell’s open beta game blends battle royale elements with Clash Royale-style unit placement. The game’s distinct sinking mechanic and fast-paced PvP battles set the game apart and offer more intensity than Squad Busters that lack strong incentives for direct combat.

However, control issues, confusing unit mechanics, and repetitive map dynamics have drawn criticism. Despite impressive mass-battle scenes players feel combat is less skill-driven and too passive compared to Squad Busters.

Scopely’s Monopoly GO has emerged as a top-grossing mobile game in 2023 amassing over 101M downloads and approximately $870M in net revenue. However, the notion of profitability in the free-to-play (F2P) model is complexly clouded by operational, accounting, and UA cost structures. The game’s success is driven by a mix of UA channels and creative strategies, reflecting the game’s ability to scale rather than guarantee profitability. With a daily UA spend rumored around $2.5M Scopely’s reliance on IP-based value and high CPI presents a challenge for short-term profitability. Analysts question the long-term sustainability and compare Monopoly GO with competitors like Royal Match and Coin Master particularly regarding licensing fees and ad inventory usage. Despite the challenges Monopoly GO has proven to be successful but the discussion around the true profitability remains nuanced.
