The game follows the heritage of gameplay specific to Blizzard RTS, with resource collection, base building, and creating armies. The game has different modes, including campaign, cooperative, and competitive. Frost Giant Studios aims to avoid pay-to-win mechanics and grind, instead focusing on allowing players to try the game for free and then purchase additional content if they choose. The studio plans to release new campaign content regularly and is committed to listening to player feedback and improving the game. Stormgate is an early access game that is constantly evolving and improving. The game blends sensibilities from both Warcraft and Starcraft, appealing to a broad audience.
