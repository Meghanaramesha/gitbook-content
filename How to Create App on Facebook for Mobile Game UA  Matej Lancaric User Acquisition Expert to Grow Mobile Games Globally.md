To create a user acquisition app on Facebook, mobile game owners must leverage the platform’s robust tools and audience targeting to drive installs for mobile games. Setting up Facebook Business Manager is the first step, ensuring all business assets are centralized for seamless management. Next, developers need to configure their app for advertising and attribution, integrating the Facebook Audience Network SDK to enable data tracking and campaign performance measurement.  
For iOS advertising, compliance with Apple’s ATT (App Tracking Transparency) framework is essential, requiring additional configurations to support targeted ads. By aligning these preparatory steps with strategic use of features like Lookalike Audiences and deep linking, mobile game developers can effectively maximize user acquisition, optimize ad spend, and attract high-quality players to their apps.

## What Do You Need to Start Using Facebook App Installs for Your Business?

To Start Using Facebook App Installs for Your Business the first thing to have before using Facebook app installs is a Facebook account. Setting up a Facebook account for your business is very easy and Facebook just asks for a few necessary details to help you out. Further, creating a business account on Facebook is completely free.

## How to Set Up Your Facebook Business Manager?

To set up your Facebook Business Manager, follow the steps below to get your Facebook Business Manager account ready and start acquiring new customers for your business. (Note that you’ll need a personal Facebook account to set up a Business Manager account.)

### **1. Create an Account**

Go to [https://business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com/) to set up your business account. Once you get there, click the Create Account button in the upper left corner.

3. Create a New Page: Choose this option if you need to create a New Page for your business.
