Survivor.io user acquisition case study focuses on how Habby, the game developer, successfully leveraged TikTok to boost user acquisition for their mobile game. The game, which belongs to the zombie survival genre, attracted a massive audience through engaging gameplay and visually appealing graphics that resonate with casual and hardcore players alike. Microtransactions within the game provided a revenue model that supported ongoing development, allowing players to purchase upgrades and enhance their experience. The use of social media platforms like TikTok played a significant role in driving downloads, as short, action-packed video clips appealed to the platform’s younger audience. As analyzed by Pocket Gamer, the success of Survivor.io’s user acquisition strategy demonstrates the effectiveness of combining captivating gameplay with strategic marketing on emerging platforms.

## Why Survivor.io is Unique?

Survivor.io is unique because it is simple and utilises minimalistic 2D graphics to deliver an immersive gameplay experience. It seems they are using the same items and hero progression as they do in Archero or Punball this time with time-based levels.

In the game, you will have to deal with large hordes of zombies. They will outnumber and surround you. The only way to survive is to kill them before they get to you.

Fortunately, the game gives a lot of options when it comes to skill sets. You can choose from a wide range of heroes with unique abilities. Each hero has a different set of skills that you can use to your advantage.

Always ensure agility and accuracy when dealing with zombies as one wrong move can be your last. They can easily outnumber and overpower you. The key to success is to always stay on your toes and be ready for anything.

## How to Save Your City in Survivor.io?

To Save Your City in Survivor.io, You have no option but to pick weapons and go out fighting.

It calls for creativity and quick decision-making. The gameplay is fast-paced, and you need to be at the top of your game at all times.

game is for nothing, if it does not have any users. We live in a world where „go big or die“ is the main mantra for business growth. If you want to make money from your app, or game, you need to convert users to customers, consumers, buyers… But you cannot do that without having them first as a users.

## What are the Skills And Weapons You Can Unlock to Advance in Survivor.io Gameplay?

The skills and weapons that you can unlock include my favourite Gatling. This is an incredible massacre machine that can take down large hordes of zombies with ease. There are many skills that you can unlock as you advance in the game. They will come in handy, especially when dealing with difficult challenges. Level up your shotgun ASAP and you are gooood!

## How to Scale the User Acquisition Like Survivor.io?

You can scale the [user acquisition](http://user-acquisition-mobile-games) like survivor.io by utilizing minimalistic 2D graphics to deliver an immersive gameplay experience where you deal with large hordes of zombies. Let’s stop a little bit here. Smells a lot like marketability testing at its best. The most crucial part of mobile games development is to lay strong foundations from the very beginning. Early marketability testing allows you to gain insights into how well your mobile game’s creative concept will perform during user acquisition, but also how your game concept resonates with the target audience. I’ve run hundreds of campaigns on different games using different types of creatives.

The best performing concepts had these things in common:

* Minimalistic graphic design
* Large hordes of units (huge crowds of people)
* Zombies
* 1 hero vs 1 million (zombies)

**Here are some creative examples:**

In order to scale your game, you need to be able to squeeze everything out of your user acquisition. Marketability is your best friend when it comes to CPI decrease. Because scaling a mobile game is all about the CPI vs LTV equation.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-21.24.53-1024x619.png)

Scaling a game is not only a function of a [killer user acquisition](https://lancaric.me/12-tips-for-killer-user-acquisition-operations/) operation. It is also a function of a LTV. You can only scale your budget until the LTV allows you to do so. Eg. If your LTV is $5, you can run profitable campaigns until you hit $4.5 CPI (or any other CPI that you calculate based on your margins) This is very simplified, because you need to take into consideration a payback period of your campaigns = when do you want to see your money back. Is it D30, D60, D90 or D365? But that would be for a separate article. Simple, right?

Currently Survivor.io is making **500k USD/day from IAP** (in app purchase) and my humble guess would be **additional 500k USD/day in IAA (in app ads) revenue.**

According to Sensor Tower data, the strongest countries for iOS are the US, KR and JP. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/j8isaNBLm7QQ0Sj1pfpfCb2rUmIhq1UE1f9B38gS3Mf-VkVYCUkyUsxJsNZKrXNC66LiVt44CJIh-dhF1ttfSKC6zs2tpSiIZmvy3YLdyqo5aIyLCtlQDYTfkzgqLvzLtFNkEPjSiBtThB7KGwxK_Tw)

For Android it’s VN, US and BR. Important to note, we see data without China (revenue wise as well),

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nsoHZZqSPtAq2_WAMhHeh3gnnclJBP8kMx5Cp1uWIiO8lAgGG-00B3Ycjs2QQg76tY9TV6i1yzhNH4_bUAZTKBEHzwIYaV1i37PxhEs6yr7BMSle3BoLoS9p3RaoOuzAbdgp14AFzRk_dXzWPJl-YTU)

Habby is a Chinese developer which means they know the Chinese market really well. I would speculate that all activities we see in the west are multiplied by 10 in Asia. Habby started ramping up spend on Tuesday 9th of August to gain momentum for featuring on both iOS and GP that happened on Thursday 11th of August. Daily downloads immediately jumped from 11k/day to 100k/day and now sitting on 400k/day. WOW!

**We can see they are utilising all big UA channels: Facebook, Google, Tiktok, Unity, Vungle, Ironsource, Applovin.**

Could you guess where they are spending the most money? Ou yeah! Tiktok it is. 50% of their budget goes there since the beginning of the global launch.

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-20.22.42-1024x435.png)

Master move from the UA playbook. This game has everything it needs to succeed on tiktok. Minimalistic design, monetisation strategy (50 IAP vs 50 IAA – educated guess), immersive gameplay = Tiktok is flooded by Survivor.io videos making it a viral hit which decreases CPIs even more. Not to mention, if you look at the top 10 highest performing ads in the US in the last 7days – 3 of them are Survivor.io. **And no, they are not showcasing real people to make it look like native content**. They don’t fuck around with fake best practices you can hear from left to right. They use what works. Gameplay, hordes of zombies, meme headlines + hyper casual [creative framework](https://lancaric.me/creative-framework-in-the-post-idfa-world/). Full stop!

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/w418g0Bf0_OAh3gbLGzh4kRkNYNYVz9RSilobNs-OBBElB4X6l-dgxGNT1GC9LmpAUABETD5QbjxM71vZgpf9YFiDkkoXUNmh1rW5vPvqylmoRdDUiLt66aB1Trn-ReM7uRBVZnR2hsNpa2SW0oxtiU)

To give you a little bit of context, currently TikTok is one of the best performing channels especially on iOS according to the [performance index created by Appsflyer](https://www.appsflyer.com/resources/reports/performance-index/). Since 2015, the AppsFlyer Performance Index has helped mobile marketers make their most important decision: which media sources to partner with.

In 2022, the ‘media shakeup’ means one thing: carefully reviewing the index is now more important than ever!

![](https://lancaric.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-21.24.34-1024x610.png)

Thanks to the huge budget spending, we can see the game hitting top ranks quite easily in multiple regions. This doesn’t mean they are spending only on iOS, quite the opposite. **They are spending on both platforms!**

The second biggest spender is [ironsource](https://www.is.com/), which was a bit surprising to me. But when I thought about it more it actually makes a lot of sense thanks to the huge hyper casual games inventory ironsource has. The game tries to look as hyper casual, but when you play it it’s definitely not. Same as Archero!

On the third place we have Google and then Unity which shows mostly Chinese creatives. Facebook, Vungle and Applovin are kinda small in comparison to the first 3. This is a great testament of how the UA landscape changed over the last couple of months/year. It’s not about Facebook or Google anymore. In order to scale your game you need to run profitable campaigns on multiple UA sources and diversify as much as possible. Or as much as LTV allows you to do so as explained earlier.

## Can You Use Same Creative Across All User Acquisition Platforms?

Yes you can use same creative across all [user acquisition platforms](http://ua-platforms-mobile-games) if you have a winning creative performing the best not only on iOS and Android but also across all UA channels

Usually, agencies or UA gurus will tell you that you need to have different creatives for different UA channels. I tend to disagree (people hate me for it sometimes) and Survivor.io is a great example of this.

If you have a winning creative it’s performing the best not only on both platforms iOS vs Android. But also across all UA channels.

With Survivor.io we can see simple gameplay variations. But! They are perfectly crafted by the developer. It’s not only gameplay capture. They alter the gameplay to showcase huge amounts of zombies, use meme headlines, hyper casual creative, fail scenarios (lose-upgrade-win) and skills upgrade concepts and that’s it. As simple as it sounds.

## What are the Creative Examples of Survivor.io?

 The creative examples of Survivor.io are as followed:

But to be fair! Their creative ideas seem to be driven by motivations that cover most types of players and game genres like **Progression, Power or Expertise.**

The point is, when you see these creatives, you want to download the game ASAP and start playing.

## What is the Difference Between Survivor.io and Marval Snap User Acquisition?

The difference between user acquisition strategies for Survivor.io and Marvel Snap lies primarily in the approach each game takes to reach and retain a diverse global audience. Survivor.io focuses on targeting casual gamers who prefer quick, on-the-go gameplay with minimal learning curves, which makes it highly adaptable for broader reach. In contrast, Marvel Snap global launch UA case study highlights a more niche-focused strategy that caters to both Marvel enthusiasts and fans of collectible card games. This creates a unique audience that is already engaged with the Marvel universe, allowing for targeted acquisition efforts through platforms and advertising channels where fan communities are active, thus driving higher engagement from the start.

Additionally, the Survivor.io strategy leverages casual gameplay, enabling a faster and lower-cost entry point for new users, while Marvel Snap takes advantage of Marvel’s IP strength to create higher initial investment in creatives and targeted campaigns that appeal to existing fans. For Survivor.io, the UA strategy optimizes for volume with broad-reaching campaigns, generating higher installs across diverse demographics. Conversely, Marvel Snap employs segmented campaigns based on user interests and demographics, often targeting superhero fandoms and communities. This targeted UA approach not only optimizes ad spend but also enhances user engagement and retention among dedicated players, as seen in the Marvel Snap global launch UA case study. Together, these cases demonstrate how tailoring UA strategies to game genre and audience preferences can drive successful global launches with distinct acquisition results.

## What are the Key Takeaways from Survivor.io User Acquisition Case Study?

Key takeaways from survivor.io user acquisition case study are given below:

* [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@two.and.a.half.gamers?lang=en) is a big contender for an UA channel of this year. Not only because of the Survivor.io example, but thanks to the performance I am able to see on multiple games. Add it to your UA channel mix as soon as possible.

* Winner creative is a winner across all platforms and channels, as mentioned in multiple webinars and podcasts. Listen to your gut, don’t always listen to “best practices”

* You need both killer UA & killer game for successful global launch and scale. It’s not easy to do it without one or another.
