##### **Takeaways**

Azur Games is one of the biggest publishers in the hyper casual market, with a focus on long-term retention and flexible publishing deals.  
The hyper casual market is facing challenges due to increased competition and decreasing eCPMs, but Azur Games remains optimistic about the potential of the genre.  
Hybrid casual games, which combine ad revenue and in-app purchases, are a growing trend in the mobile gaming industry.  
Azur Games’ portfolio includes a mix of hyper casual, mid-core, and casual titles, with Slime Castle being their current top revenue generator.  
Azur Games emphasizes the importance of profitability and ROAS targets in their publishing strategy, while also being open to unique and innovative game concepts. The development of mobile games involves testing and iterating on ideas and drawing inspiration from other successful games.  
Working closely with external developers, especially from China and Korea, can lead to successful partnerships and the acquisition of high-quality games.  
The creative process for advertising campaigns involves testing and iterating on creatives, as well as using AI to improve performance.  
Azure Games has a large team with multiple in-house studios and external partners, and they are constantly hiring and expanding.  
Monetization strategies should be tailored to the specific game and its target audience, and skip-it features may not work well for all games.  
Reaching out to publishers early in the development process can provide valuable feedback and potential support for iterations.
