It’s easy to get stuck when something is not working. Sometimes even the smallest relevant tips can elevate & motivate on a journey to achieve more growth & better UA results.

Trough my newsletter, I want to bring you the motivation you sometimes need to keep going and growing your business and your expertise.

## 3. Learn UA strategies

Learning new strategies is the core of my articles. Whether you are interested in recent platform changes, IDFA shannenigans, creative frameworks or other UA related shit, here you will always learn something new.

Brutally honest newsletter is the way for you to keep up your professionalism up to date through the newest insights in the fast-moving gaming industry.

## 4. Learn through case studies

From time to time, I publish interesting global launch case studies of different games. My goal when creating these case studies is relevancy and actionability.

I always want to create data-driven case studies that are beneficial to any marketer or game developer. My case studies showcase methods in action, their real-life results, and how can you replicate each case study’s success.

An essential part of these case studies I publish is that they showcase fails and mistakes that help you avoid making these mistakes in your business.

For example, read following to get a taste:
