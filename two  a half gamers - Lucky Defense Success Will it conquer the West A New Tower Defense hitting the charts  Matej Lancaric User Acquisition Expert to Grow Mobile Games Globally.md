##### **Summary**

In this episode, the hosts discuss the game Lucky Defense, which has gained popularity in South Korea. They explore the unique mechanics of the game, including the importance of luck and the specific units that players should focus on. They also discuss the artifacts that affect gameplay and the challenging nature of the game’s gacha system. The hosts highlight the difficulty of understanding the game without external guides and note that the game’s success is primarily in Asia. The conversation discusses the gacha mechanics and gameplay of the mobile game Mythic. The hosts highlight the unique features of the game, such as the ability to directly purchase units and the high randomness of the gacha system. They also explore the difficulty levels and the cooperative gameplay in the Dungeon mode. The hosts express their frustrations with the game’s balancing issues and the reliance on specific units for success. They suggest that the game could be improved by designing units and monsters with different strategies and adding more variety to the gameplay. The conversation discusses the ad placements and monetization strategy of the game Random Dice: PvP Defense.
