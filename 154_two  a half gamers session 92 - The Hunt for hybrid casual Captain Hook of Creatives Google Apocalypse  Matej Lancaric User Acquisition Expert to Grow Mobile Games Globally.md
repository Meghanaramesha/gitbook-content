This is no BS gaming podcast 2.5 gamers session #92. Sharing actionable insights, dropping knowledge from our day-to-day User Acquisition, Game Design, and Ad monetization jobs. We are definitely not discussing the latest industry news, but having so much fun! Let’s not forget this is a 4 am conference discussion vibe, so let’s not take it too seriously.

**Takeaways**  
We have experienced significant growth in their subscriber base.  
The hunt for hybrid casual games is a major trend in the industry, with companies like Habby, Voodoo, and Crazy Labs leading the way.  
Google’s recent changes in ad monetization have had a significant impact on publishers, particularly the end of a popular ad monetization hack.  
The revenue profiles of different game studios vary, with some experiencing growth and others facing challenges. Hooks play a crucial role in driving user acquisition and can significantly reduce CPIs.  
The best hooks are those that are unique, attention-grabbing, and seamlessly connected to the gameplay.  
Creatives that use real-life footage or well-known celebrities can be highly effective in capturing users’ attention.  
Weird and sexist creatives should be avoided as they can negatively impact the brand image and user perception.  
Matej will be speaking at PGC London and invite listeners to attend their talks.  
There will be a party organized by 2.5gamers during PGC London.  
The podcast has partnered with Games Forum and will have a live session at the conference.  
We wish you a happy New Year.
