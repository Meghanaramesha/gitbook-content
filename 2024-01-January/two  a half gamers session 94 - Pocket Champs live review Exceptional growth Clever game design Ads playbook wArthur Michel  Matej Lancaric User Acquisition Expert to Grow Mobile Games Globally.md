**Takeaways**  
Pocket Champs features strategic decision-making in gear selection and offers a balance between player input and automated gameplay.  
The game’s progression systems, such as the trophy road and events, provide short and midterm objectives for players.  
Matchmaking in Pocket Champs is challenging due to the low skill involvement, but efforts are made to create a meaningful player experience.  
The game’s monetization strategies, including offers and battle passes, are designed to provide value and maintain a robust economy.  
Continuous iteration and risk-taking are essential for game updates to keep the player base engaged and the game fun for the long term. Game development teams should have ownership and control over their games.  
When adding new features, it is crucial to consider their purpose and how they connect with the existing game.  
Finding features that make sense and enhance the player experience requires time, iteration, and creative work.  
Passion is essential in game design and development.
