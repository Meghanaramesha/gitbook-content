**Summary**  
In this episode, the hosts discuss various topics related to ad monetization and game design. They share tips on finding creative inspiration, incorporating mini games in ads, iterating on creative winners, and optimizing ad revenue. They also discuss the challenges in ad monetization and the impact of recent changes by Google. Additionally, they highlight the benefits of event-driven ad placements and provide updates on the Review Radar segment. In this episode, the hosts review several games on the radar, including Fight for America, Empire Takeover, My Perfect Hotel, Mr. Autofire, Alien Invasion, Top Troops, Estote, Warcraft Rumble, and Zen Lesson 0. They discuss the performance, revenue, and updates of each game, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The hosts also share their thoughts on the future prospects of these games and the potential impact on the market. In this final part of the conversation, the hosts announce an after party event and discuss the availability of tickets. They also mention their upcoming meetup at PGC in London. The conversation concludes with closing remarks and a reminder to subscribe and join their Slack community.

**Takeaways**  
Some games on the radar are experiencing steady growth and stable revenue, while others are declining or struggling to gain traction.  
The success of a game often depends on factors such as gameplay mechanics, updates, and the target audience.  
Developers should consider diversifying their portfolio and exploring new genres to avoid cannibalizing their own games.  
The performance of games can vary greatly, even within the same company or genre.
