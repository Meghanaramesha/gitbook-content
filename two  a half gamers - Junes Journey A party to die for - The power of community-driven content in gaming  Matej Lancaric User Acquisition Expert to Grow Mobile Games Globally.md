##### **Summary**

In this episode, Matija Lanceric interviews April from VUGA and Ed from MediaBodies about their collaboration on a video series called ‘A Party to Die For’ to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the game June’s Journey. The series is a real-life murder mystery backed by influencers, with players as the detectives. The project involved extensive planning, including selecting contestants, writing the story, creating puzzles, and organizing the production. The series was released on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, and received positive feedback from the audience. The success of the project highlights the power of community-driven content in engaging and re-engaging players.

##### **Takeaways**

Collaborating with influencers and involving players in a video series can be a powerful way to engage and re-engage the community.  
Planning and executing a project like this requires careful coordination, from selecting contestants to writing the story and creating puzzles.  
Community-driven content that tells a good story can be a more effective marketing approach than traditional advertising.  
Long-form videos can be engaging and successful in driving player engagement, especially when combined with interactive elements like puzzles and QR codes.  
Even with a limited budget, smaller-scale community content initiatives can still have a significant impact.
