**Takeaways**  
Saygames has seen significant revenue growth, with the top month reaching over $5 million in IAP revenue.  
My Perfect Hotel and Tower of War are the top games in terms of revenue and downloads.  
User acquisition is primarily driven by Applovin, Google, and Facebook, with Mintegral and TikTok also playing a role.  
Advertising spend on Facebook is relatively low in the US, indicating a focus on the EU markets.  
The game’s core gameplay and progression mechanics are strong, but there is room for improvement in adding more mechanics and progression layers.  
Retention rates are relatively good, with around 40% on day one and 3% on day 60/90.
